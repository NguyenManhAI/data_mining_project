Jake Fleischer,5,Amazing Stuff,"Reviewed in the United States on February 10, 2024",Color: Classic BlackVerified Purchase,0,This mouse can be dragged through hell and back and still work. I have beaten this mouse more than my wife and it still operates like it's brand new. The scroll wheel kinda broke after a year in service but for the price I will take that. Get this mouse NOW if you were on the fence about it.
Ashton Cooper,5,"""Essential"" is the right word!","Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2024",Color: Classic BlackVerified Purchase,0,"There are a lot of different gaming mice out there but a lot of gaming mice on the market in my opinion kind of just over do it. They are just way to expensive or have to many unneeded features (like 12+ buttons, covered in rainbow RGB lighting, wireless or have a super weird shape/feel)

I just need a simple gaming mouse…

I was at tech-school for my training in the Air force (I know, weirdest place out of anywhere) and I had my gaming laptop mailed to me so on my days off, I could play games with my sister & friends. For a long time I used a basic Dell computer-lab work mouse, and it gets the job done but I thought maybe it was time for a fun upgrade. There was a GameStop at a mall and there I bought a white colored Razer DeathAdder Essential Gaming Mouse. I'm going to tell you now… I immediately LOVED it! Perfect balance of a gaming mouse with some cool features but not overdoing it. Exactly as it says in the name… it's the basic essentials for a gaming mouse! And for the price of $30? Not bad at all.

The size, shape and feel is really good. not overdoing it in my opinion, giving a great ergonomic feeling when in use. The two extra side buttons are great and not overbearing (like with some mice and their 6+ extra buttons all over the mouse) two, in my opinion, are just enough. Lastly the fact that it's wired is nice, helps with price & simplicity. It has some RGB lighting but not all over the place or crazy so no complaints for that.

I rebought one but in the color black so it better matches my laptop and gave my sister the white colored one. Had the white one for almost a year and had ZERO issues or problems with it. If you want a simple, nice and cool gaming mouse that is just the ESSENTIALS this is for you!!!!"

Alvin Jacobs,5,The Perfect Gaming Mouse with Exceptional Performance,"Reviewed in the United States on June 16, 2023",Color: Mercury WhiteVerified Purchase,0,"The Razer DeathAdder Essential Gaming Mouse in Mercury White has truly won me over with its outstanding performance and sleek design. As an avid gamer, I was looking for a reliable and feature-packed mouse, and this one ticks all the right boxes.

Let's start with the build quality. The DeathAdder Essential boasts a robust construction that feels comfortable and durable in hand. The rubber side grips provide excellent control and prevent any slippage during intense gaming sessions. The mercury white finish adds a touch of elegance to my gaming setup, making it a visually pleasing addition.

The heart of this mouse lies in its 6400 DPI optical sensor. The accuracy and precision it offers are exceptional, ensuring smooth and responsive tracking. Whether I'm engaged in fast-paced FPS battles or performing precise movements in strategy games, the sensor performs flawlessly, delivering the utmost accuracy and minimal cursor jitter.

The five programmable buttons on the DeathAdder Essential are a gamer's dream come true. The customization options available through Razer Synapse software allow me to personalize the mouse according to my gaming preferences. I can assign macros, remap buttons, and create profiles for different games, giving me an edge over my opponents.

One standout feature of this mouse is the integration of mechanical switches. The satisfying clicky feedback they provide adds a tactile element to my gameplay. The switches are incredibly responsive and offer a satisfying tactile feel with each press. Combined with the smooth scroll wheel, the overall responsiveness and precision make gaming an absolute joy.

The software support from Razer is top-notch. The Razer Synapse software is user-friendly and offers a wide range of customization options. I can fine-tune the DPI settings, adjust the lighting effects, and even calibrate the mouse to different surfaces. The software also allows me to sync my mouse settings with other Razer devices, creating a cohesive gaming experience.

In terms of value for money, the DeathAdder Essential exceeds expectations. Considering its competitive price point, it offers a remarkable set of features and performance that easily rivals more expensive gaming mice on the market.

Overall, the Razer DeathAdder Essential Gaming Mouse in Mercury White is a stellar choice for gamers seeking a reliable, high-performance mouse. With its ergonomic design, customizable buttons, accurate optical sensor, and mechanical switches, it elevates my gaming experience to new heights. Razer has once again proven why they are a leader in gaming peripherals, and I have no hesitation in giving this mouse a well-deserved five-star rating."
Mike Eckman,5,Great Mouse for Basic Use,"Reviewed in the United States on February 7, 2024",Color: Classic BlackVerified Purchase,0,"I disagree that this mouse is considered a gaming mouse. Other than the fancy logo and color changing LEDs, there is not much about this mouse that caters it for gaming. I use gaming mice and prefer ones with more than just two side buttons, and a much heavier weight. This is a lightweight mouse which is fine for office work where you're in front of a computer 8 hours a day, but I would much prefer something different for gaming.

But as a general use office mouse, it works great. It is ergonomic enough to be used right or left handed, the scroll wheel works fine, and the buttons press with a reassuring CLICK. For the price, use this in your office, but if you want to get into a Call of Duty or Fortnight tournament, definitely get something else."
Gabriel C.,5,Elevate Your Gaming Experience with the Razer DeathAdder Essential,"Reviewed in the United States on January 18, 2024",Color: Classic BlackVerified Purchase,0,"My gaming journey reached new heights with the Razer DeathAdder Essential Gaming Mouse, a truly essential companion for any gaming enthusiast.

Tiff,5,Borrowed one and fell in love,"Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2024",Color: Classic BlackVerified Purchase,0,"My mouse broke after years of hard use. In a pinch I borrowed this mouse from my daughter who uses it for gaming. In one sitting, I fell in love with a mouse in a way I didn't know was possible. It's quick, smooth, and fits beautifully in the hand. I immediately ordered my own. I wanted a corded version, but I think you can get it Bluetooth if you prefer. So happy."

But Razer Deathadder Essential does enough without being too overwhelming. It has two buttons for your thumb and a very quick reaction to your movement. The scroll wheel is clickable and freely moves with many stops to keep it in exact positions.
I bought this when my wireless Deathadder became a little glitchy and found the Deathadder Essential as a perfect replacement. For a gaming mouse under $25, I cannot recommend it more!"

Ann,5,"Pretty, simple, and great quality!","Reviewed in the United States on January 10, 2024",Color: Mercury WhiteVerified Purchase,1,"I own this mouse in both colors now and use it everyday for both gaming and schoolwork. After using my black one for about 1 1/2 years, I can say I've had no issues. The light up detail on the mouse is pretty and matches my new setup- it's white on the white mouse and green on the black mouse.

The two side buttons are useful as key binds in many games and to go back and forth with webpages and I'm happy there isn't a DPI button near the scroll wheel- no accidental DPI changes. The mouse also has a slightly matte texture on the top which makes using it enjoyable. Not a very heavy mouse, is a good size for an average length hand."

Bolokai,5,Let me tell you why the other reviews on here are WRONG,"Reviewed in the United States on July 12, 2022",Color: Mercury WhiteVerified Purchase,0,"1. This mouse is not ""lightweight junk"".
2. Braided cables are worse.
3. Silicone side grips were never that great.

Some of the reviews on here are ridiculous. Let me clear some things up.

The Kailh switches in here are mid-weight and feel slightly heavier (and less mushy) than the optical switches in the Deathadder V2. The side buttons feel significantly better than the V2. The scroll wheel is less tactile (or smoother, depending on how you look at it).

This is a heavy, heavy boy by today's standards. This thing is better built than the V2, but consequently harder to do a weight reduction mod because the plastic is so damn thick.

People that complain about this version not having a braided cable... you want an even less flexible one?! Razer's braided cable is the same rubber cable with an additional outside sheath, making it even less flexible. This cable is an improvement from years past, but it's not great. Fortunately because it's not braided, it's easy to rip the rubber sheath and shielding off, and paracord it.

The side grips are meh. It's a bit more than molded plastic, but not as noticeable as the silicone on the V2. Silicone still gets slippery when wet, so best solution was always aftermarket grips. If the V2 had G703 quality rubber grips to being with, then I could see the grip complaints on here being justified.

My biggest problem with this thing is the lack of replacement skates. No corepads or tiger ice for this model. It has the rear skate of the V2, but two front skates more similar to the V2 Pro. If you you like the white color or mechanical switches, and use less than 6400dpi, then can't go wrong for $20 and some elbow grease.

Not ""professionally"" and I don't even intend to try. I imagine there is a need for very advanced mice. So if that is you, maybe check reviews by people who intend to game+stream for a living to ensure you are getting the really in-depth look and the best information. If you need durable laser mouse and enjoy games, and are trying to find that sweet spot between buying quality and not breaking the bank, I think this is your mouse. I probably got it on sale, but my Logitech M500s broke a second time (RIP good buddy) I decided I would just try a new mouse. That Logitech was basically everything I needed and wanted in a mouse but I figure Razer made nice stuff and I wanted to try a simple corded mouse with a few extra buttons. This was everything I needed and more. It has 1) a light on it and 2) some software to install. I didn't really want to but I installed it. I think you have to register. I did. It wasn't a pain but it's a mouse. You should plug it in and use it and that's it. The bad thing is the light. It's a green light and bright. That's completely unnecessary. You can easily turn it off with the software you install and I did. Beyond that, I have everything I need. It feels great in the hand. The additional buttons are in sensible places and that helps with games. The scroll-wheel is just fine. Great mouse! Turn the light off and it is even better."
Smith,5,Smooth as butter.,"Reviewed in the United States on May 16, 2023",Color: Classic BlackVerified Purchase,0,Nice Teflon pads on the bottom. Slides nice on a mouse pad. Such a nice size for my large hands I didn’t even feel the size difference from my old one. Sometimes a new mouse feels too odd for a few days and you never really like it. Something rubs on your hand or finger and gets annoying. Not this one. It feels great in my hand. Only thing I did not like is the fact when I added it to my computer it started to load software. How did it do this? Is there files on the mouse in some sort of memory that ran when I plugged it in? This was razor unique software and not windows it tried to load. Sure it’s convenient but what if it auto loaded spyware or a virus? I don’t like how it forced its software on me. I stopped the download and deleted the software. Buyer beware I guess.

All mice wear out, especially ones for click-heavy uses like gaming. This one is IMPOSSIBLE to beat for the price - more expensive mice often have higher resolution or fancier button layouts, but they routinely cost three times as much, and don't last any longer before wearing out.

Steven B.,4,Does its job,"Reviewed in the United States on January 28, 2024",Color: Classic BlackVerified Purchase,0,"I had used an old Death Adder Elite at work that began having issues with the scroll wheel. I didn't want to spend $80+ on a new one, so when I saw the price tag on this one I was immediately curious. The shape seems to be identical to the one I had (the reason I wanted another one), but the only complaint I have is that the Elite I had had a rubberized pad on either side that made it a bit ""sticky"" to your fingers so you could pick it up and reposition it easier on the mouse pad. This mouse does not have have those rubberized pads, so I have had it slip out of my hand when trying to grip it to reposition. So far, though, that is the only complaint I have with the mouse. Clearly a cost-saving measure to keep the price down, but something I didn't expect and immediately noticed."
Clint H.,4,Awesome and Affordable - Razer DeathAdder Essential Gaming Mouse Review,"Reviewed in the United States on January 1, 2024",Color: Classic BlackVerified Purchase,0,"I just got the Razer DeathAdder Essential Gaming Mouse, and I really like it for my gaming setup.

First off, it feels good in my hand. The design is simple but comfy, and the textured grips on the sides keep it from slipping during long gaming sessions. It's not too fancy, but it works well.

When it comes to gaming, this mouse is top-notch. It responds super quickly and accurately, making my game moves smooth. I can also change the sensitivity settings to fit how I like to play different games.

The mouse is tough and well-made. It feels strong, and the buttons click nicely, adding to the gaming experience. What's cool is that it doesn't cost a lot, making it perfect for gamers who want quality without spending too much.

Sure, it doesn't have all the fancy lights like some other mice, but for the price and how well it works, I'm okay with that. It's a solid choice for gamers on a budget who still want a good gaming mouse.

In a nutshell, the Razer DeathAdder Essential Gaming Mouse is awesome and won't hurt your wallet. It's comfy, works great for gaming, and is a smart pick if you're looking for quality without breaking the bank. I totally recommend it!"
Luke Thorssen,4,BEST BUDGET MOUSE! Only one compaint,"Reviewed in the United States on January 14, 2024",Color: Mercury WhiteVerified Purchase,1,"I LOVE this mouse. I got it after getting back into PC gaming after a hiatus.

PROS:
-Feels great in-hand.
-Cable is plenty long.
-It's not heavy, but it has a decent weight to it.
-Build quality is solid.

CONS:
-The only bad thing I have to say about this mouse is after a couple months of daily use, the scroll wheel sensors don't function properly. After doing some research, it looks like dust builds up on the sensor, making the wheel ""bounce"" when scrolling.

SIMPLE FIX: Blow into the space between the mouse and the scroll wheel. If you have pressurized air that will work much better. It's only a temporary fix, and can get annoying, but it does fix the issue!

Other than that one issue, this mouse is incredible for the price. Likely will upgrade to something a little more ""pro"" in the future, but for the last few months this has held up great, and I'll likely use it for another 6+ months before upgrading."

It's movement is very smooth and responsive, and the top buttons and mouse wheel all feel great and work well. For me, the issue is the buttons on the left side, which are used for forward/back in a web browser. The buttons are so large that I frequently bump them when I reach for the mouse, disturbing whatever I'm doing. I know I can disable them by using the included software, but I am not currently running that software, and I don't want to have yet another service/application running simply to disable two mouse buttons that are in the way."

The side buttons feel like they'd wear out fast and I don't really use them, but because of that I truly can't speak of their quality.

No mouse for this cheap compared to this beast of Razer products. No problems included with this mouse... except maybe the biohazard awaiting in its box.

Amazon Richard,4,First usage of 'better' mouse,"Reviewed in the United States on February 24, 2023",Color: Classic BlackVerified Purchase,0,"I wanted to title this ""First usage of a high-end mouse"", but at this price, it isn't really high-end, but it is a step up from the cheaper mice, and I wanted to see what it was like.

I am impressed (mostly).

It is a heavier mouse, but that makes it feel more solid, and I like that a lot. I also really, really noticed the very smooth gliding of the mouse, and like this a lot.

I don't do head-to-head gaming; most of my games are solo playing. I don't really see much of a difference with this mouse over the old mice.

I'm really used to 3-button mouse, so I really don't know what to use the two extra mouse buttons for (they are on the left side of the mouse, and they won't be accidentally clicked as long as the grip stays in the lower area. I looked up some suggestions, but I was a bit disappointed that some key combinations don't work (I was hoping to map ctrl+windows+left to one button and ctrl+windows+right to the other, but it doesn't seem to realize when I press the windows button).

That brings us to the software.. you have to install it to adjust the lights or assign the buttons. The EULA basically says that they collect data on usage. I did want the lights to turn off after a time, and I like the ""breathing"" light... so, for now, I'm running it (the effects don't stick when you don't run the program). I don't trust the software that comes with the mouse. There may be some other way to control it.

Aside from the software, I'm impressed by my foray into fancier mice.

UPDATE:

It's been less than a year, and it has worked pretty well. However, as others have noted, the mouse wheel is beginning to give me difficulties. If it gets worse, I will need to replace the mouse, and I won't be buying this brand again."

Pauly P,4,A GREAT Budget Mouse for Gaming,"Reviewed in the United States on May 2, 2023",Color: Mercury WhiteVerified Purchase,0,"I recently purchased this gaming mouse and have been very impressed with its performance. The 6400 DPI optical sensor is highly accurate and responsive, allowing for smooth and precise movements during gameplay. The mouse is also highly customizable, with five programmable buttons that can be tailored to fit your specific gaming needs.

One of the standout features of the DeathAdder Essential is its ergonomic design. The shape of the mouse is specifically designed to fit comfortably in the hand, reducing strain and fatigue during extended gaming sessions. The textured side grips are also a nice touch, providing additional traction and control.

The build quality of the DeathAdder Essential is excellent, with a sturdy construction that feels durable and long-lasting. The braided cable is also a nice touch, adding to the overall premium feel of the product.

Overall, I highly recommend the Razer DeathAdder Essential Gaming Mouse for anyone looking for a high-quality, responsive, and customizable gaming mouse. Its ergonomic design, accurate sensor, and programmable buttons make it an excellent choice for gamers of all skill levels."

The mouse is the deathadder essential but the cable is rubber instead of braided and the sides are textured plastic instead of rubber. I'm fine with that but the images are not correct and it would be nice to fix that.
As for the mouse it's a good shape and works well but I find that it's not as nice feeling as the other razor products. My Big complaint is the sides are slippery since its just plastic but grip tape could help. I'm also not a fan of the deep arch in the left side but that's personal preference.
Overall conclusion: it'll work if you are tight on money but If you are willing to spend a little bit more I think the deathadder v2 would be a better buy."

After about 2 weeks of use the scroll wheel went up even after scrolling down. This is a major problem for me, but it might not be for others. When I play games (mainly shooters) I use the scroll wheel to switch between weapons. When I'm out of ammo and I switch my gun it'll just end up switching to secondary then back to the main weapon, which has no ammo in it which to no surprise ends up getting me killed. Other than that excellent mouse, it's lightweight and feels good in the hand. Would recommend that you use the scroll wheel sparingly."

After researching the issue on the Internet I have found that if you blow into the side of the scroll wheel it usually fixes the issue for a while. Not something you should have to do for a manufacturer of this 'caliber'.
Stephanie,4,No Thrills Mouse,"Reviewed in the United States on June 3, 2023",Color: Mercury WhiteVerified Purchase,0,"It's a USB mouse with 2 extra buttons on the side (yes, I know it says 5 but that includes scroll wheel, left and right clicks). There's nothing really special about the product and it works fine. The clicking is loud on the mouse and the side buttons are as well. The white light on the mouse is really bright, but the intensity can be changed in the Synapse software. I wouldn't purchase it for gaming as there's very little control and extras on this mouse."

It started just 4 months after buying a new model. I thought Razer was a premium brand for mouse, how disappointing. First and last time i buy a razer mouse
[edit]
Well, I cried wolf too quick. I went to the razer forum and a proposed solution was to blow some air to remove dust, if any. I don't have compressed air, so I just blow some air with my mouth, and it fixed the issue. So 4 stars, the mouse is good. I just hope razer would be more cautious with dust infiltration, but after all that's a budget mouse in their catalog... can't ask too much."

The two issues i have are that the mouse is much larger than most who haven't tried a deathadder would expect, and the clicks are semi-heavy. The weight is fine, because i don't use it for gaming anyway, the feet are smooth, the look is clean, and the shape would be nice, except for the size. For anyone who has tried a glorious model d, or roccat kone pro, or any average sized ergonomic mouse, which filled up your hand, this will be even larger. The cable is rubber, but very nice and light for a rubber cable, which makes it usable. Overall, a very solid mouse."

Amazon Customer,4,Great Mouse - Essential Version is arguably the best (DPI Switching is actually not very helpful),"Reviewed in the United States on December 2, 2021",Color: Mercury WhiteVerified Purchase,0,"I have been running a DeathAdder for the ergonomics for over a decade now, and picked this up to match a particular build aesthetic. I also run a black DeathAdder essential on my other computer, for broadly the same reason.

The white version is prettier, the white LED backlighting is actually quite soft and much more pleasing to the eye. The only downside is that the white version runs a cheaper non-braided cord (still white), otherwise I'd recommend the white one wholeheartedly. Honestly, if you want the aesthetic, I'd still recommend it.

Razer - Please keep making the Essentials line - I'd like to get an 'Essentials PLUS', that has the same fixed DPI (Better, IMO - can't ever mess it up, and mouse performance is great like this), but with ARGB enough to have user set fixed colors. That's all I really want/need out of a mouse."

Brady,3,"Edited Post: Was happy, now I have to return it :(","Reviewed in the United States on October 8, 2023",Color: Classic BlackVerified Purchase,0,"Edt October 12th, 2023 -
On the 9th, the right click started acting funky. I restarted my PC and unplugged and replugged it in, and it fixed. However, I believe this was coincidental. On the 10th, the right click started acting HORRENDOUS. As in, triple clicking, clicking when not pressing, dropping clicks entirely... Restarting and replugging it did not change a thing. Tested on another PC, same issue. Swapped out cable extenders, same issue. Attempted plugging it directly into the PC, as inconvenient as that would be in my setup... still the issue. Multiple ports, no help.

I firmly believe stuff happens. Quality control is not, and never will be perfect. I ended up reordering this mouse off Wal-Mart to see. So far it is working flawless. The mouse is incredible, I think I got unlucky here... again. I also ordered an EVGA X20 off Amazon. Hope it goes better, too. I still think overall I would recommend this product, as it wouldn't have such a high rating so consistently if this happened incredibly often. I will dock a few starts, but I honestly still think the mouse it good.

X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X

Original post -
I first ordered a Redragon M910K, and it was faulty. I decided to put 10 extra dollars in and order this mouse instead.

Take note this is a day one review and if I have problems, I will update. Assume this is all still relevant if you see this review after a couple months and I haven't edited it.

First Impressions
-Glide is good. Feels very smooth.
-Cable pulls the mouse slightly due to the smooth glide. However, not much, and if your cable is tied forward, or simply going straight, you won't notice it. Just don't have your cable go off at an angle immediately and you need not to worry.
-Feels very... non-durable? I wouldn't slam it. If you aren't a heavy rager, it should be fine. Hit your keyboard instead. NOT CHEAP FEELING THOUGH. Feels perfectly fine for this price!
-Simple look. Black with Green LED's. Perfect printing on the logo.
-Side buttons are a bit high for me, if your thumb rests low like mine, you may have a hard time reaching them. That's why the ""Ergonomic"" is a 4 star, but only from a personal stance not an overall stance.
-Very Comfortable. Enough said

Overall, I am very happy with this, and if this review is un-updated, I still am. Just waiting for the software to install to change my DPI currently. If you are looking for a good mouse below $30, this is a good mouse. A very good mouse.

Would I recommend it at this price range? Yes.

Best regards from a fat idiot"

The mouse still completely functions, however, when clicking and holding the left button, it will occasionally ""let go"" of the click function (even though the button is still fully clicked), meaning whatever files I'm in the process of dragging get dropped wherever the cursor happens to be -- which is really problematic in my line of work as a video editor.

I realize it's not the most high-end mouse, and I was using it almost daily for those nine months, but to not even make it one year is highly disappointing."

Maybe it’s just the one I received, idk but it isn’t the actual DeathAdder Essential produced by Razor. It does not connect to Razer’s Synapse program, is not detectable at all, and I tried downloading updated drivers for it, but it does not register as the DeathAdder at all. When viewed in the setting as devices, it registers as “Gaming Mouse” where as typical Razer Peoducts are detected as their actual model name. This may not be a big deal to everyone, as I as I said it does technically work, but the idea of the item being sold as a fake, and being up charged to its amount is bad business. I tried to register the warranty as well, and it had already been registered, so this is possibly a refurbished unit, which is why it’s not being detected?

Good tactical feedback from the buttons. And, the wheel allows for precise scrolling. However, when you first plug in the mouse, it wants to install software. A read of the license finds some scary stuff that anyone that's interested in their security can't agree to. Luckily, the mouse works without installing the software. Sadly, that also means you're buying features that aren't usable."

It was a great and reliable mouse that I loved using. Unfortunately, it got lost while moving. This was my second Death Adder Essentials mouse.

I purchased this mouse expecting it to be just as good as my previous Death Adder. I was disappointed when I discovered that the left mouse button had less travel and felt noticeably mushier than the right button. I understand that these buttons have manufacturing tolerances and they often don't feel exactly the same, so I tried to ignore it, but after several days of coding and constantly being aware of the mushiness of the left button compared to the right one, I was losing my freaking mind. I ended up returning this mouse and using a $5 Microsoft mouse that a friend of mine had in a box in a garage. Now I can code without having severe anxiety. Yay."

The delay was disappointing since we needed it sooner. Surprisingly, it arrived in excellent condition despite being packed in one of those white plastic shipping bags, which often result in damage to non-clothing items. Setting up the mouse is straightforward, and it includes a couple of side buttons, making it great for gaming as intended. I already own the same model in white and it's worth noting that this version no longer comes with a braided cord, although this isn't a major concern. I just like braided cords and figure there might be others out there that prefer it as well. Overall, it's a solid, basic gaming mouse, and I recommend purchasing it if you're considering it – you won't be disappointed."

Unfortunately they dropped the quality considerably. If feel A LOT worse in the hand. the plastic is rough in a cheap gross way, the cable is now plastic instead of braided so it drags more and will break more easily. I am thoroughly disappointed. I cannot recommend razor as a brand then the quality of their same product varies this much. Mouse is fine for the price, if you have an extra 10$ laying around id say buy something better because even if the sensor and buttons are fine the bad hand feel ruins it all."

For me it lasted about 5 months and the scroll wheel has just decided to take a dump. Scrolling up or down faster than one step a second makes it jitter around the opposite way. I use this PC primarily for programming and web but I do game and It's just not a good gaming mouse either for the same reason. Other than that it's great, it fits the hand well, it's good for small or large hands, it feels good, great response--but, it's also a wired mouse. Great response should be a given. An operational scroll wheel should also be a given for a $25 wired mouse. Not happy with this purchase and won't buy again.

UPDATE: After throwing the mouse against the wall in anger, the scroll wheel operates as it should once again."

I scroll down and it'll register some of it as scrolling up, meaning if a game has keybinds with the mousewheel like Monster Hunter World, then it messes up your gaming.

L. Love,3,Not Quite the Thing I Needed,"Reviewed in the United States on December 28, 2022",Color: Classic BlackVerified Purchase,0,"The good news is that the product is sleek, tracks well, and has great ergonomics. I would rate it a genuinely great buy except that the left-side, rearward (away from the cable) button does not work. Hmm, I thought maybe it needs programming, so I downloaded the app. A bit clunky, it recognized the button being pushed, but offered no way to switch its function with a working button. Clearly from the software, it is not defective, it is just unrecognized. I did some online searches only to find this is a very common problem with this mouse - button 4 does not work. The suggestions were the usual, unplug and replug - to no avail. Tried on a different machine, still not recognized.

If you do not need that particular button, treat this as a 5/5 review. If you do, there really seems to be no guarantee you can make that button work. Caveat: this is on a high-end Windows gaming PC - your mileage may vary on some other platform."

But it broke after 1 month of use, the scroll wheel would teleport around when I used it, at first it was annoying but then it got frustrating especially with shooters, or playing a sniper. Even worse it made me miss questions on my midterm, since scrolling would teleport me all around a page. If it didn't break, It would of been a perfect mouse, both for cost and use."

Pros:
-Lightweight
-Good price
-Simple
-Pleasant ergonomics

Cons:
-At around 6 months, the mouse wheel will start to wear. It starts glitching out slowly at first. You'll be scrolling down in your browser and the page will jump up a bit. Then it becomes impossible to scroll.

It's like watching your pet age and begin to suffer. Except the pet's life expectancy should be a few years, instead of months.

I REALLY hope Razer can pickup the quality of this scroll wheel. It's the only mouse I'd ever use. I never eat or drink around my computer. I don't touch my mouse or keyboard with sticky fingers. I dust regularly. Just be forewarned, the scroll mechanism WILL wear out within a year."

Morgan,2,Not so great,"Reviewed in the United States on August 23, 2023",Color: Classic BlackVerified Purchase,0,"I am thoroughly disappointed with the Essential Gaming Mouse with a 6400 DPI Optical Sensor. This product has proven to be a major letdown in terms of its performance, build quality, and overall functionality, making it a frustrating and unsatisfactory gaming accessory.

First and foremost, the performance of the gaming mouse is severely lacking. Despite its claim of having a 6400 DPI optical sensor, the accuracy and responsiveness of the sensor are far from impressive. The mouse often exhibits erratic tracking and inconsistent cursor movement, making it virtually impossible to achieve precise aiming and control in games.

The build quality of the gaming mouse is also questionable. The materials used feel cheap and flimsy, and the overall construction does not inspire confidence in its durability. The mouse's buttons and scroll wheel lack a satisfying tactile feedback and feel unreliable during gameplay.

Moreover, the ergonomic design of the mouse is uncomfortable for extended use. The shape and contours do not provide proper support for the hand, leading to discomfort and strain during prolonged gaming sessions. This significantly hampers the overall gaming experience.

The customization options for the gaming mouse are limited and lack user-friendly software support. Customizing buttons, DPI settings, and macros should be intuitive and convenient, but the software provided with the mouse fails to deliver a seamless experience.

Furthermore, the product's performance in games with fast-paced action is particularly disappointing. The mouse's sluggish response and lack of accuracy make it ill-suited for competitive gaming scenarios, which defeats the purpose of an ""essential"" gaming mouse.

The price paid for this gaming mouse is far from justified considering the poor performance, subpar build quality, and lack of comfort it offers. I expected a product that would enhance my gaming experience, but I received a subpar accessory that only detracts from it.

In conclusion, the Essential Gaming Mouse with a 6400 DPI Optical Sensor is a significant disappointment due to its poor performance, uncomfortable design, lack of customization, and overall lack of value. If you're seeking a gaming mouse that delivers accurate tracking, comfort, and customization options for an immersive gaming experience, I strongly advise looking elsewhere for a product that offers better quality, functionality, and value for your money."
AEK,2,Quality has gone down,"Reviewed in the United States on September 19, 2023",Color: Classic BlackVerified Purchase,1,"Razer mice used to be nice. I had a couple in the past. They all eventually died due to physical breakdowns. Hard to troubleshoot, to clean and maintain. The first Deathadder when released, it was great. The other one purchased, I have noticed a drop in quality and them feeling inferior.

With this one, it died on me within a year. Wheel started misbehaving - would scroll up and down on its own. Time to clean. Went and opened it and removed the two wheels (large one and smaller one). The led under the large scroll wheel is positioned so that the removal of the wheel is almost impossible. Most likely you will break the motherboard sitting inside the wheel with the led light. I did. The way it was placed there you think they did it intentionally so you cannot remove wheel to clean.

The smaller wheel (internal, and connected to the larger scroll wheel) was a pain to remove out for cleaning. I cleaned it, but nothing good came out of it. Large scroll wheel stopped responding. I suspect the combination of it and the smaller wheel is the problem. I tried a few times to set it in and have it work, but to no avail. Not responsive.

Razer should be concentrating on making lasting mice (but again, in this age, they want to sell you 10 mice over the course of 10 years - good business practice, environmentally bad... but I digress). The led lights too should not be a primary focus of the mice. Should be longevity of mouse not flashy lights that will blind you in the dark. Sure, you can disable them via software, but why not have them disabled by default. I think most people want a mouse to play and use and not flashing lights and distractions.

Fact that it is super hard to clean, and that you will break the internals is almost guaranteed with this one. I had to throw mine out, not working. My attempt to clean made it worse. Not happy nor impressed with this one. I am getting the wired SteelSeries Rival 3 for a similar (+/- $5 difference) hoping it will last longer."
Connor R,2,Likely done with Razer,"Reviewed in the United States on September 12, 2023",Color: Classic BlackVerified Purchase,0,"Most of the complaints I have about this mouse are the same complaints I've had with every Razer mouse I've ordered in the last 8 years or so; middle mouse click sucks and always gives out way quicker than the rest of the buttons. This one just happens to have the extra negative of having a squishy feeling scroll wheel on top of that and it was giving off small little squeaks with every multi-scroll situation.
Additionally, the sensor on this was absolutely worse than my last cheap Deathadder ripoff and the build quality is barely better than that at 15 more bucks. Really not worth the cut in price from the higher tier edition wired Deathadder, but I didn't feel like dropping the $65+ that Razer prices those at when I had to replace them once every year or two because the middle mouse button gives out so quick.
I tried this one again after my cheap ripoff brand because I saw it at like $20 on prime sale, but honestly it feels the same as any mouse in the 10-20 dollar range so the real price is definitely not worth.
Overall, if you're like me and enjoy the shape of the Deathadder but hate Razer's software/build quality/general annoyances, there are other products to try instead on the cheaper and more expensive sides. I'm gonna be looking to try a more expensive option this next time though so I don't have to replace a mouse in a year again."

However, I haven't had it for a full year and the left click is now super inconsistent -- sometimes it doesn't register when I click, and sometimes if I hold down the mouse button (click and drag, which I have to do a lot) it will act as though I halted my click partway through. Nothing precipitated this, I didn't smash the mouse, it just stopped. Really sucks because I loved the mouse. Now I will probably be switching to a Logitech mouse."

It wasn't worth it for me to figure out how to take a video showing me scrolling down and the screen going up, so I cut my losses and just bought a second one assuming the first was a fluke. Now, a few months later on my new one, the same issue is happening. Great mouse, if you don't use the scroll wheel. I've abandoned ship and moved on to a different brand at this rate. Disappointing."

Lezah,2,Having to replace after about a year of use,"Reviewed in the United States on December 11, 2023",Color: Mercury WhiteVerified Purchase,0,"This mouse was great- while it lasted. After about a year of use, the scroll wheel has a mind of its own. Want to scroll up? That’s too bad. It’s going to scroll down, then up, then down. I use my computer for gaming, but primarily use a controller. I’m not big on playing mouse an keyboard except for on a very limited number of games. So, this mouse wasn’t put through much gaming and still At about a year a started noticing the scroll wheel problem. It’s now been a year and almost 3 months and I’m replacing it because the scroll wheel just doesn’t work how it should and is quite infuriating. If you plan on replacing your mouse every year- this one would be great. If you want something that lasts - look somewhere else."

mth,2,Unreliable scroll wheel,"Reviewed in the United States on November 21, 2023",Color: Classic BlackVerified Purchase,0,"After less than a year of light use, the middle scroll wheel has started to randomly jitter backwards from the direction in which it is rolled. This is a shame, because in most other respects the mouse is quite good; good size and shape, and click buttons seem decent (other than the two side buttons which I did not like, and which I am muting via X-Mouse on W10). But the scroll wheel is the main function I use for navigating long web pages and <1 year of operation is just unacceptable. In comparison, the scroll wheel on the Logitech MX518 I've had for over a decade is still going strong, so there is no excuse for this kind of early component failure."

It's definitely for taller people. I plugged it into my MacBook Pro and it works like a mouse BUT... the adjustment range is useless. Even with the tracking speed slider at max, the mouse moves to slow. The Synapse software from Razer does not run on Macs. That would have at least helped with tuning the mouse, but no. This mouse has two left-side buttons like on the Orochi and on the Orochi, clicking those would adjust tracking speed on-the-fly (no drivers required). Not so with the DeathAdder. So for now I'm stuck with a sluggish mouse that cramps my hand. Visiting the Razer site was no help either, I couldn't find a corded mouse that would fit my hand. They also have not a single image showing the relative size of each mouse against each other. So my next experiment is to buy the $6 AmazonBasics mouse and see if that is any better. It promises to be smaller than the DeathAdder, but we will see. Don't buy the DeathAdder unless you are a large person with a PC."

At first, I noticed it was being a little weird every now and then (jumping long lengths with just one flick up or down, once in a while) about a month in. Now I scroll one direction only and get no where because the scroll fluctuates up & down rapidly, 2 months in, completely infuriating and practically useless. Huge bummer since I'm very careful & gentle with everything I own (I've never once broken phones, mouse, keyboards, etc).
I was ready to accept it was just my experience, perhaps just one unfortunate faulty mouse that I was unlucky to receive, but after doing research about my issue I've come to find out this is a common issue for this mouse. If I would've known, I would've gotten a different mouse that didnt have this common issue. Not worth the money or hassle, even if it is cheap, just save your money for something more reliable! :(
No photos because the mouse appears fine physically, and gave 2 stars instead of 1 because besides the scroll wheel, it works fine. But a broken scroll wheel is such a detriment to it's entire purpose, imo."
Nga Nguyen,2,"Disappointing, there are better mice.","Reviewed in the United States on July 7, 2022",Color: Classic BlackVerified Purchase,0,"Very disappointed, the cable is quite short compared to most other mice on the market, this wasn't a problem for me since my pc was close by but it is noticeably shorter so it might be for others. For some reason the cable is also a rubber one instead of braided. Even for 18 dollars I would invest a couple more bucks into some other options. It is a heavier mouse, I understand its a bigger mouse but there are other options that are similar in size and much much lighter. If you are used to a light mouse don't switch to this one. Another thing is that you have to have the Razer Synapse software in order to adjust the dpi so you can't just plug it in and game. Your sensitivity will be completely off, for me it was defaulted at 1600 dpi which quadrupled my sensitivity. However the worst thing about this mouse is probably the lift off distance. The lift off distance is extremely high where as even in other ""budget"" mice the lift off is much much shorter. This means that you have to lift the mouse quite high in order to adjust or else the sensor will still track. This is a huge issue in video games especially FPS when you are aiming. Some pros however are that the shape and buttons are fine. The side buttons have little pre travel which is a common issue in many mice."

UPDATE to 2 stars!: the scroll wheel now skips and is awful. Extremely disappointed. I have 2 razer mice, the other 1 costs 3 times as much as this one, yet they both have developed this issue. These mice aren't even used for gaming, just office work. I was a big razer fan but have been switching to SteelSeries pretty steadily as the quality is very poor and declining in recent years in Razer products. I used to own only Razer peripherals (accessories) for the computers, but now it is only these 2 faulty mice and a headset which is very touchy and has constant issues.

I would save my money and not buy this. Get something similarly priced that will last you longer. SteelSeries for example, however there are others which are better quality than Razer at an equal or lower price."

Within 2 months it developed a habit of scrolling in the opposite direction of where I was spinning. Razer support claims it's a dust problem and it's fixable with a quick burst of an air duster.

It's not a difficult job, but I have had decent mice of other brands last much longer before any maintenance was required. While cleaning, I found dust and dirt inside the mouse, so it might behoove Razer to seal their products a bit better.
Update: I now have to disassemble the mouse monthly to clean the scroll wheel. Razer offers absolutely no advice other than to use compressed air to clean it and make certain software and firmware are up to date. The company has no way to contact them once the warranty expires, so I have dropped my rating from four to two stars, and have decided I will not purchase any of their products in the future."

Over those ten years, I've gone through roughly 5 deathadders, with each having a shorter lifespan than the last.

The biggest thing to call out is the scroll wheel. Both the click and the spin itself are notoriously faulty - the latest deathadder I purchased has a botched scroll wheel after just a few months of use. Scrolling is completely erratic even with careful movements, and the mouse prior stopped registering scroll wheel/MB3 clicks.

Bought one of these from game stop a couple years ago. Has worked great, and still does. But I wanted to get a new one since the scroll wheel has started to act funky after all the abuse (spamming bhops)

I noticed a few issues right away. The left and right clicks were both way stiffer than on my old one, and the right click seemed to be slightly stiffer than the left.
Second issue I noticed was that it does not glide smoothly at all. 1 glide foot is uneven making its corner dig into the mouse pad. I can literally hear it. it sounds like if you drag your finger nail on the pad. This also affects aiming.
Third issue is the thumb buttons. my old one has buttons that click like the 2 main buttons. the new one has buttons that make a hollow/cheap sound.
Fourth issue, It feels lighter. this wouldn't be a problem, but im looking for the same mouse ive grown accustomed to. I don't want to have to relearn muscle memory.

Issues 1 and 2 may fade with time as the mouse is broken in, but im not going to bother finding out. Its not the model advertised so im returning it."

The firmware still doesn't work) The firmware updater, Razer Synapse 3.0, refuses to detect this mouse and update it. Downloading the firmware from the official site and trying to apply it directly has the same result. In short, they are not supporting this product at all. Do not buy.

Edit #2 I am now approaching my third run through of customer support. It has been a literally month since I first started trying to get this mouse refunded. Every step has been littered with inconveniences seemingly designed to make the customer give up on getting a refund, and go away.

They have asked me for the same serial number three times, along with all the other info about the issue, the invoice; everything. They've also made me fill out a promise - the same promise I filled out the last two times - that I have tried a shit ton of unrelated things to make the mouse work again. Now, for the third time, after waiting weeks for a resolution, they have decided to restart the whole process and ask me from verification of my address in the form of bills, utilities, etc. I'm moving, so I can't give that.

To be fair, I haven't found a razer mouse under $100 that lasts longer than 10 months without a scroll wheel or double/triple clicking problems. Maybe their quality sub-100 is just designed to fail before a year, but I haven't bought anything pricy enough to compare. Don't expect this mouse to last longer than a year without a miracle if you use for gaming a lot.

**NOTE**: Y'all save your money, this one in particular isn't worth it.

I contacted tech support, and this was my worst experience with tech support, which seemed completely incompetent to me. They never solved my problem, although I helped them as much as possible in this matter. They simply refused to solve the problem. I returned the headphones to where I bought them.

Unfortunately, I bought the mouse from them before the headphones, and everything seemed to be fine with it until that moment. I wrote to technical support now, since the return period on Amazon has already passed. I hope I can get my money back for this poor quality mouse.

And so, in my experience, there are already two devices from Razer - both do not work as intended, plus poor technical support (which is also not easy to reach, you need to answer a lot of questions first)."
K,1,Poor quality mouse wheel,"Reviewed in the United States on October 16, 2023",Color: Mercury WhiteVerified Purchase,0,"I know its a cheaper entry level mouse, but the quality of the mouse wheel is a deal breaker. The wheel won't last long at all and will start jumping all over the place with inconsistent response. Its not even usable for web browsing, let alone gaming or anything else more productive after a few months of use. This is my experience with two of these things. If the wheel were better/lasted it'd be a great option.

Update: Setting this to a single star after attempting to deal with Razor to get support. They make it incredibly difficult. They required me to provide them proof of purchase and serial numbers 3 different times to even get a ticket going and then they go out of their way to be difficult. They actually suggested that the reason my mouse wasn't working is because the USB cord may not have been straight enough then that response will be followed by a note that they will close the ticket in 48 hours. They do everything they can to not provide you help or resolve your issue. Go with something else, anything else."
Moose Of Evil,1,"Yup, the dreaded scroll wheel skipping/bouncing issues have already shown up.","Reviewed in the United States on February 28, 2024",Color: Mercury WhiteVerified Purchase,0,"This mouse almost lived an entire three months before the dreaded scroll wheel skipping/bouncing popped up. I would ask as to why a product that was this shoddy would be allowed to be sold, but then I remember that I only paid $23 for it (It's been perpetually on sale for the last three months, can this be why?), so I'm not going to panic, I'll just simply buy someone, anyone else's mouse and go with that and pitch this in the rubbish bin.

That, or I'll give it to my mother-in-law, and gaslight her into thinking that nothing's wrong with the mouse."
Daniel W,1,Just another mouse without always logging into a Razer online account,"Reviewed in the United States on November 22, 2023",Color: Classic BlackVerified Purchase,0,"This is a nice mouse as far as quality of materials and comfort. The scroll wheel friction is a good compromise between free movement and control, though I prefer a little more spin. There is no adjustment. The buttons activate with very light pressure and have a distinctive click sound which you can hear and feel providing positive feedback. Basic decent mouse, full stop. To do all the other things that you are paying good money for you need an active online account to manage the ""cloud"" profile. So to control the lighting, set functions, program macros etc, you must be online. You can do some of this with a guest account, but they still collect your data for which Razer knows who the owner is. Synapse 3 no longer offers an ""offline"" mode that was available with version 2, and yes, this affects all Razer products."
Michael Rodrigues,1,"Worst Scroll Wheel Ever, DO NOT RECOMMEND FOR YOUR SANITY!!!","Reviewed in the United States on July 19, 2023",Color: Mercury WhiteVerified Purchase,0,"Purchased this mouse awhile back because I needed a good white mouse for my all white PC build. Worked great for a couple a months, until the problem started happening. Out of nowhere the mouse's scroll wheel started misbehaving and became jumpy. Scrolling up would randomly cause it to scroll down (and vice versa) or it would just scroll in place, refusing to scroll at all. It became incredibly frustrating to deal with. I started looking online to see if others had this issue, and it turns out it's an issue that Razer has never addressed. So I started to look at solutions on Reddit. Everyone said to just replace the mouse, but I didn't want to just incase the problem could be fixed. One person said that ""blowing really hard into the scroll wheel or using a can of compressed air could fix it."" So i tried just that. It worked for about a week and I was relieved. Then it started happening again to the point where eventually blowing into the scroll wheel only fixed it long enough for a single Call of Duty match. I finally was fed up with it and replaced the mouse soon after. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!!!"
Santiago,1,It broke out of the blue.,"Reviewed in the United States on January 10, 2024",Color: Classic BlackVerified Purchase,0,"I bought it a year ago, however, I'm not a person who uses the computer a lot, only to check emails or write documents, so I didn't use the mouse practically for anything either. Until now that I'm going to use my computer, I realize that without having even touched it, the cursor was automatically directed to the corner and no matter how much I moved the mouse, it stayed in the corner. I disconnected it to see if I had pulled the cable or if it was a problem with the USB port and no, it was the mouse. I practically didn't use it, much less neglect it, and it got damaged anyway."

I've tried contacting razer support, which was a huge hassle to even start a warranty claim with them. I went back and forth with 5 different customer service agents, who asked for the same information and suggested the same troubleshooting tips.

Steven Schronk,1,Mouse Wheel Failed In Three Months,"Reviewed in the United States on January 19, 2024",Color: Classic BlackVerified Purchase,0,"I unfortunately have two of these mice now. Both of them have a poorly designed wheel that stops working very quickly. Seems that instead of using a optical sensor for detecting the position of the wheel, a very cheap position sensor is used. The contacts for the position are very thin and have little chance to have a reasonable lifespan.

Tried to RMA the product, but the site makes it very difficult to contact them. Looked all over the site and cannot get the process started."

I did not have access to my internet anymore. I uninstalled the software programs and it temporarily fixed it. It occurred again even without the software programs installed a day later. DO NOT BUY!!! Save yourself the pain of having to buy a new internet adapter or hard drive.. I can't stress this enough, just get items like these from Best Buy or the official website.

Second mouse broke at 4 months of useage.,"Reviewed in the United States on August 19, 2023",Color: Mercury WhiteVerified Purchase,0,"This is the second purchase I've made of the same brand and model. I had to replace the first one after owning it for a year because when I would scroll, the page would skip upwards and downwards a bit. I took it apart, took a can of air to it to blow off any dust, and put it back together. Still having the skipping issue. I figured it was just an issue with this particular mouse and bought a new one. It hasn't been 4 months since I've owned it and I'm having the skipping issue AGAIN. To be clear, I don't live in a dusty environment or with pets. I can't figure out a discernable reason for this to continue happening. I do have another Razer mouse (it's about 6 years old) on my work computer and it is still going strong with zero issues. I suppose it's only this newer model that's having issues. Until Razer addresses and fixes this model, I highly suggest for you to use another brand."
Adwo,1,Junk,"Reviewed in the United States on March 22, 2023",Color: Classic BlackVerified Purchase,0,"I had this mouse for 2 months before it started glitching and the scroll wheel did not work. I don't know why I thought it would be different than any of the other Razor products I've owned. Razor is absolute trash marketed towards the gaming community. They look cool and have edgy names but the quality is just not there. The only reason Razor products are used by ""pro gamers"" is because they are gifted to them. Sure they might be good for a tournament but, are probably tossed out afterwards because they are unreliable for long term use and Razor will just provide new peripherals anyway. As long as they are seen using Razor products by the average Joe and e-sports fanboys.
Razor products also come with bloatware that may or may not affect the performance of your rig. This is something you don't have a choice in since factory settings are intentionally set to unplayable standards.
I have had much better success with other brands and even off-brands which cost less, last longer and perform better. Every Razor product I've ever owned hasn't lasted more that a year and has been replaced by something I am using two or more years later."

I googled double clicking and this mouse model and saw many reports of this issue.
Life is too short, so I just bought a competitor's mouse and am moving on. I think, the fact that this product lasted me about 2 weeks, and is now in the junk pile, this was extreme low value plus heartburn, research, and inconvenience."

After about a year of ownership, the scroll wheel stopped working reliably. As seen in the video when you scroll down it will sometimes jump up instead.

After 9 days of emailing back and forth, and speaking to five different agents as well as providing the same information four or five times, going through numerous trouble shooting steps on the computer including uninstalling and reinstalling software, my warranty was finally denied because I purchased the mouse on Amazon and the seller was not an ""authorized"" reseller."

For example, I'll be scrolling down and the wheel will randomly jump up and down instead of smoothly scrolling.

I had 1 replaced under warranty and the replacement failed within 4 months. Because I didn't want to be without a mouse while waiting on a replacement, I chose the option to pay for the replacement first, have it shipped to me, then receive a refund one I returned the defective mouse. I received a confirmation email that my return was received, but Razer never refunded me for the replacement I purchased.

I liked this mouse enough that I didn't mind buying it again. I immediately noticed that the new one has a cheaper USB plug. The old one was gold plated, which allows for the electric current to travel faster. The new one is clearly not gold plated. I think it's worth mentioning this so people can be aware of what they are buying.

Update: It's been 6 months of using this and the scroll wheel is now having issues. As I'm scrolling up or down a page, it will keep going the opposite direction for a moment, so mouse wheel scrolling feels like a battle as I'm going down, jerk up, going down, jerk up, etc etc. They clearly made this product with cheaper material and it's falling apart.

They forced me to provide screenshots of me asking Amazon. Can you believe it? Then a day after confirming it was a hardware problem and making me beg Amazon, they came back to me AGAIN and asked me for a video of the problem to prove it was a hardware problem. Even though they already confirmed it was a hardware problem. The goalposts keep moving.

Also, they gave me hassle about buying this through an Amazon third party seller (fulfilled by Amazon), and not Amazon directly. Apparently you're only supposed to get a warranty on this item if you buy it through an approved seller. What a joke.

The scroll wheel starts out fine but after a month or two it starts becoming inaccurate. The best way to describe this inaccuracy is that it becomes jumpy and when you scroll it is very imprecise.

As a device used for gaming it is not very good as you may scroll past the item you meant to select or if you are playing a game where you constantly need to zoom in and out it is bad to have an unreliable scroll wheel. As for general use it is more useable, but not using the scroll wheel makes every website and general workflow a hassle.

A temporary fix is to blow into the scroll wheel space - the same issue I had with my old razor except that was for the mouse clicker. If I had just bought an $8 Logitech mouse I would not be having this problem. Probably done with Razor because they can't figure out how to avoid these basic issues.

I'm also having scroll wheel problems others have posted about. If I try to scroll very fast, it becomes confused and will stop or even scroll backwards. Other than that, the sensitivity is great. Very accurate for playing an FPS. An affordable option for gaming."

But you get what you pay for: The scroll wheel response is jumpy. Sometimes it scrolls up when you're trying to scroll down, or scrolls down when you're trying to scroll up. As I'm writing this, the vendor has no published fix for this. Just the generic, ""try blowing canned air at it"" and ""make sure to update your OS and mouse drivers before you ask us for help"" type stuff."
Juan D,1,It didn't work,"Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2024",Color: Classic BlackVerified Purchase,0,"The product arrived at its destination but it didn't work, it's not compatible with Razer drivers, its origin is from China"
James Bass,1,Often Double Clicks or Clicks on Its Own,"Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2023",Color: Classic BlackVerified Purchase,0,I have bought two of these and they all have the same problem. They double click which can cause problems when gaming or just doing general computer work. I have tried high-lighting text to copy and before I was finished the mouse clicked on its own and ruined the copy/paste. I do not recommend buying these and I defiantly will not buy again.
Amazon Customer,1,Scrolling wheel stopped working properly,"Reviewed in the United States on November 19, 2023",Color: Classic BlackVerified Purchase,0,"Within one year of use, the wheel stopped scrolling/zooming in and out properly all on its own. I have a wireless Logitech mouse and keyboard that are older than this mouse and even cheaper that are still performing perfectly.
In fact, the older and cheaper Logitech is what I'm using right now. Otherwise I would be stuck and searching for another mouse."
Sushi Cat,1,Wanted to like this.,"Reviewed in the United States on July 2, 2023",Color: Classic BlackVerified Purchase,0,"My son uses this for school work and gaming. Within a year of owning this mouse there's something odd with the scroller. I can scroll down and up but it the scroll will randomly swap to go to the other direction. Does the same thing on windows or mac machine. So say if i scroll down to view bottom of page, continuing to scroll makes the screen go back up to top of page. I can't seem to find any fix and it's past warranty, so sad this one didn't work out."
Grave,1,Not sure if defective or just loud,"Reviewed in the United States on February 27, 2023",Color: Classic BlackVerified Purchase,0,"Got this to replace a older $12 non name brand mouse had for a couple years that was starting to get old and had several razor mice over the years but honestly wasn't sure what to expect given price point on this one. Overall feel and control of the mouse is fine basically what youd expect for a gaming mouse. The fatal flaw though is the mouse wheel, it squeaks extremely loudly with any movement and its like nails on a caulk board. Seems like proper clearance wasnt given between the wheel and the track it sits in but ive tried to ignore it for almost a week hoping it would break it and wear down or loosen up but sadly it has not and im honestly about to switch back to my old mouse and just order another like it."
Dan,1,Scroll wheel stopped working after less than a year,"Reviewed in the United States on October 10, 2023",Color: Mercury WhiteVerified Purchase,0,"This mouse is not built to last. The scroll wheel started bouncing after less than a year, meaning that if you scroll down it will sometimes act as if you scrolled up, and vice versa. It makes the mouse extremely annoying to use. Save your money and buy a good logitech mouse."
Ramona Hurst,1,Scroll Wheel Died In 6 Months,"Reviewed in the United States on December 4, 2023",Color: Classic BlackVerified Purchase,0,this little thing lasted about 6 months before the scroll wheel began scrolling in the opposite direction as it was supposed to. really good for gaming if you like being terrible
Brandon F,1,Terrible mouse - 3rd unit with a jumpy scrollwheel,"Reviewed in the United States on September 25, 2023",Color: Mercury WhiteVerified Purchase,0,"BUYER BEWARE...The mouse is good looking...comfortable...but the scroll wheel is garbage on these newer razer products. DO NOT BUY! The wheel will start reverse scrolling. There is no long term fix. Blowing into the scroll wheel area with your mouth fixes it for 2-3 days. Always comes back, identical on all 3 units. Razer support will either tell you to kick rocks or just give you another unit thatll fail again"
Jeff,1,Low cost mouse that broke in a few months.,"Reviewed in the United States on November 17, 2023",Color: Classic BlackVerified Purchase,0,Scroll wheel bounces screen upwards when scrolling down. This happened only a few months after I started using the mouse. 2nd mouse that from razor that had low quality builds. Very disappointed that the mouse broke so quickly. Scroll wheel seems to be a common problem from my search online...

Really disappointed and probably won't consider razer products again. If i scroll down itll randomly go up and down at the same time making your scroll null and does not work."
yyc,1,Very good in itself,"Reviewed in the United States on December 5, 2023",Color: Classic BlackVerified Purchase,0,"I only used it for 4 months and the middle wheel stopped working. It was very frustrating. I really like this mouse, so I lost another one."
Adam Miller,1,Scroll wheel is aweful,"Reviewed in the United States on March 13, 2023",Color: Classic BlackVerified Purchase,0,"Call me old fashioned, but I prefer a scroll wheel to consistently scroll one direction, not jump all over the place when I'm reading a page. This seems to be a Razer issue of late. I had a Naga that also had a scroll wheel that got jumpy after a few months of use. Prior to this I had a death adder that lasted for years (5 I think) before the right click finally gave out. I have been disappointed that two mice in a row have failed so quickly. I've tried updating drivers, and cleaning the mice internally. I do not recommend this brand anymore and I plan on going with a simple $20 mouse with a scroll wheel that works."
Cathy Ha,1,Failed after three months.,"Reviewed in the United States on November 18, 2023",Color: Classic BlackVerified Purchase,0,"A slow fail where the scroll wheel operation became intermittent and worsened over time. When scrolling one direction, it sometimes skips and scrolls the other direction. Skips re often greater than the progress in the correct direction."
Misty,1,Scroll wheel breaks after a few months,"Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2023",Color: Classic BlackVerified Purchase,0,The scroll wheel breaks after a few months. The right mouse button is now having problems too. This is not a quality item.
SCSI KING,1,Only Mouse in 30 years to fail after just 1 year - Bad scroll wheel,"Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2023",Color: Classic BlackVerified Purchase,0,"I've been in the business since 1992 of computer building, selling and repair. I have NEVER EVER had a scroll wheel stop working properly EVER. It bounces and studders when I try to scroll down any web page. I finally tried it on my laptop and same thing. What a piece of #!@#. Don't believe the hype. Stay away from this brand."
Alex P,1,problem after 1 month,"Reviewed in the United States on February 5, 2023",Color: Classic BlackVerified Purchase,0,"I recently gave this as a birthday gift to my brother and fast forward a few weeks later I spoke to him, he told me he replaced this mouse already because it was having a problem when scrolling. So I went to check on it and saw that when he was scrolling down, sometimes it jitters/twitch (I don't know the scientific term for it) where it looks like is spasming between scrolling up and down, before it continue scrolling down again.
I always thought Razer was a well known brand, I guess that was not my experience. I guess you get what you pay for."
D. Marquis,1,The scroll wheel will drive you crazy eventually,"Reviewed in the United States on May 22, 2023",Color: Classic BlackVerified Purchase,0,"The mouse has a good feel to it weight wise, good tracking accuracy, and is generally easy to use. Until that is you use the scroll wheel. I do not know what Razer has done to get such a terrible to use scroll wheel in an otherwise good product. It started with just occasionally scrolling the wrong way whilst using it to scroll now it will constantly reverse direction scrolling while trying to do pretty much any task that involves the scroll wheel. This is my first Razer product and due to this may be my last. Save your money and buy something else."
Bradley Knudson,1,Within 1 month of gaming use the mouse is double clicking,"Reviewed in the United States on November 12, 2023",Color: Mercury WhiteVerified Purchase,0,"Love the feel, and the look. If you are buying this for a high click MMO like OSRS please don't. With in 1 month of using it, it's already having double click issues."
Jim B,1,Razer used to be good,"Reviewed in the United States on September 6, 2023",Color: Classic BlackVerified Purchase,0,"I have had this mouse about 5 months and the scroll wheel causes the page to jump a lot when used.
I have gone on the website and TRIED to follow the directions.
Never could get past all of the screens to start a firmware download.
Won't buy Razer again that's for sure!"
Keaton,1,Razor is trash if this is how they make products,"Reviewed in the United States on October 3, 2023",Color: Classic BlackVerified Purchase,0,"This mouse was so bad i went back to using my old BROKEN mouse after a month. Its too big, like way too big even for my large hands. It gave me terrible hand pains from the ergonomics. The scroll wheel broke extremely quickly.

The PC Tech Guy,1,"Scroll wheel issues after half a year of use + no warranty do to ""unauthorized reseller""","Reviewed in the United States on October 3, 2023",Color: Mercury WhiteVerified Purchase,0,"Like others have reported, I too started having scroll wheel issues half a year in to using this mouse. What's worse is that I guess I bought from an unauthorized reseller on Amazon here, so I didn't get any warranty either... I guess I'll see if it's possible to clean it myself."
Jonathan Kim,1,Double clicking issue within 2 weeks,"Reviewed in the United States on October 5, 2023",Color: Classic BlackVerified Purchase,0,"I had previously bought the same model before, which lasted around 6 months until the wheel became unresponsive (going in opposite direction as to where I scroll)
So I thought I'd give this model another try.
This time left click started double clicking with in the first 2 weeks, extremely disappointed."
A,1,Didn't even last six months,"Reviewed in the United States on August 26, 2023",Color: Classic BlackVerified Purchase,0,"Decent, affordable mouse. The scroll wheel started failing after only three months.

Five month update: The scroll wheel now barely works and the left mouse button clicks rapidly when held down. I wasn't expecting much from a $20 mouse but this thing is absolute garbage."
Steven,1,"Cheap, light, and still clunky","Reviewed in the United States on September 7, 2023",Color: Classic BlackVerified Purchase,0,"I bought this mouse because it had great reviews. This mouse is cheaply built very light and yet somehow it still feels clunky. The left click button has a very heavy click, and the scroll wheel is very stiff. For a couple more bucks you could get the Logitech Hero."
jrk5306,1,Bad scroll wheel,"Reviewed in the United States on September 9, 2023",Color: Classic BlackVerified Purchase,0,"Having issues with the scroll wheel, now half the time the scroll either doesn't move the page or it scrolls the wrong way. Bought less than a year ago. Razer return policy states that only items bought through razer.com can be returned so I think I'm out of luck."

Katherine S. Moore,1,Will not buy again!,"Reviewed in the United States on January 31, 2023",Color: Classic BlackVerified Purchase,0,"This is the second Razer product I have bought and will be the last. Several months ago I bought a Head phones and they just lost all volume after 1 month turned it to maximum could barley hear anything. This mouse is super small for my adult hand, and now 2 months in the wheel doesn't work right I scroll down it bounced down and up. Very disappointed with this mouse. I typically buy this price point and they ALL do break but usually after 1-2 years. I have not had any luck with Razer at all."
Amazon Customer,1,cheap mouse.,"Reviewed in the United States on January 6, 2022",Color: Classic BlackVerified Purchase,0,"Definitely no rubber grips, it's plastic like all other reviews. Had double click issues after a couple weeks of using. (click once but register as double, which gets very annoying).

The only good thing about it is that its cheap. So if you need a mouse and doesn't have money, then this will technically work. But if you have the means, then maybe spend a bit more and look for a better mouse.

*Edit* changed from 2 to 1*. Yes, it's even worse since only after a couple month of use, the scrolling wheel now have issues. Every time you try to scroll down a page, it'll scroll up instead, making it very frustrating to use. So I would highly recommend that you buy another mouse, even if this one it's cheaper. The double click/scrolling issue happens daily and isn't just worth the frustration, even if it's cheap."
sean wang,1,Quality issue,"Reviewed in the United States on September 7, 2023",Color: Classic BlackVerified Purchase,1,This was recommended by my son. Bought few months ago with medium load usage.

However, my excitement was short-lived as the scroll wheel stopped working after just two weeks of use. To make matters worse, when I approached the customer support for a refund, I was met with disappointment and frustration. spend a little more money on something nicer it will be worth it in the end !"
Nate Kucsma,1,Worked great for a month - then became totally unreliable.,"Reviewed in the United States on July 18, 2023",Color: Mercury WhiteVerified Purchase,0,Let me first state that i'm not even using this for gaming - simply for office work. For the first month it was great. Love the extra side buttons and the mouse wheel was super responsive. After just one month though it started skipping when scrolling and then became nearly unusable unless you were scrolling very deliberately. Very disappointed as the product itself looks and feels good but it doesn't perform well at all.
Michael Wood,1,"Ergonomic, but bad manufacturing; scroll wheel malfunctions after less than 6 months","Reviewed in the United States on March 14, 2023",Color: Classic BlackVerified Purchase,0,"The mouse is comfortable and fits my hand well. But after less than 6 months, it's already breaking down. The scroll wheel inaccurately tracks my scrolls, jumping back and forth as I try to scroll in either direction (horribly annoying for my work). I wish I could recommend this mouse, but I have to recommend against it because now I see many other critical comments citing the same thing and especially because I bought this to replace a generic, cheap-as-they-come mouse that cost a third of the price but lasted me five times as long without wearing out."
EPB,1,"I *ABSOLUTELY* HATE this mouse, buttons are waaay too sensitive","Reviewed in the United States on October 27, 2021",Color: Classic BlackVerified Purchase,0,"I was recommended Razer over my favorite brand, but this mouse is waaaay too sensitive, in any other mouse I'm used to be able to rest my index and middle fingers on the left/right mouse buttons and just click as necessary.

I have normal hands and normal fingers, I've done this since the mid 90's and never had a problem with any other mouse...

This mouse however has uber sensitive buttons that get clicked at the slightest movement, I need to raise my fingers or pretty much hold the mouse with just my thumb and pinky to move it while my index/middle fingers hover so they don't accidentally touch and click the buttons to the point that it's tiring, the most natural way to use a mouse is by resting your hand/fingers over the buttons and to apply some slight pressure to be able to push the buttons... not with this mouse however.

Absolutely DO NOT recommend it."
M,1,Every Razer Deathadder I've gotten has encountered the double click issue,"Reviewed in the United States on July 14, 2023",Color: Classic BlackVerified Purchase,0,"Every Razer Deathadder I've gotten has encountered the double click issue where the mouse buttons will begin to randomly click twice when clicking, an extremely frustrating experience. My most recent Deathadder lasted only 2.5 months before running into this problem. It's a shame because otherwise the mouse shape is one of my favorites, but the poor quality I've encountered multiple times over the years is enough to make me stop buying mice from Razer."

Kane,1,"Bad scroll wheel, ghost clicks","Reviewed in the United States on January 3, 2023",Color: Classic BlackVerified Purchase,0,"I've had the mouse for a little over a month. The scroll wheel is unusable. Whether scrolling at low or high speeds its action is completely unpredictable. Both the direction and speed of scroll are inaccurate. Have also noticed issue with ""ghost clicks"". For example while clicking and dragging the scroll bar on a website it will frequently stop scrolling and start highlighting things on the page. Notice the same issue in VS code. I'll try to click and drag to highlight some text and it will randomly stop highlighting and click elsewhere on the page while I'm still holding the mouse button."

Matt Z.,1,Double Clicking Menace,"Reviewed in the United States on January 16, 2023",Color: Classic BlackVerified Purchase,0,"This mouse was fun for the few months I got to use it. Nice and ergonomic, satisfying to click and use. But, the double clicking started already.

An attempt to get support or an exchange from Razer is a joke, they want you to record a video of you blowing compressed air into the mouse, I'm not jumping through loops to get something fixed that shouldn't need the repair in the first place.

I'm not going to be a customer of Razer ever again, and have just ordered a new mouse from ANOTHER company."
Cutty,1,Mouse scroll wheel is garbage.,"Reviewed in the United States on May 7, 2023",Color: Classic BlackVerified Purchase,0,"I don't know if this is due to the manufacturer or seller, but this mouse's scroll wheel is garbage. You can't scroll up without it bouncing down. You can't put any pressure on it or you end up highlighting everything in a browser window.
This is a gaming mouse, right? Who makes the scroll wheel so sensitive (and software doesn't fix this problem) that you can't use it?

Anyway, I definitely regret buying this for my kid, because he's so nice he never tells me if the gifts he gets even work right."
AmazonCustomer,1,Scroll wheel defect - Buying from Amazon voids warranty,"Reviewed in the United States on October 6, 2022",Color: Classic BlackVerified Purchase,0,"Per Razer - “ products purchased from non-authorized dealers <Amazon> are often used, counterfeit, re-boxed, defective or gray market goods.”

The major defect in this product is the scroll wheel. It is very unpredictable - if you scroll up, it might go up (or not), it could go up and down and back up, or scroll up and then bounce down. This is a problem on windows with/without the synapse software, and also tested on a Mac.

Before buying this, do a quick google, the scroll wheel problem has been reported for years. I expect synapse to have better quality standards. They will not fix it because it came from Amazon."
VerifiedUser,1,Scrolling bar issue,"Reviewed in the United States on August 17, 2023",Color: Classic BlackVerified Purchase,0,The mouse was perfect until the scroll started getting worse.
