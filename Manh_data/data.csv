Marcie,5,Anker a great reliable product I have used for years in various formats.,"Reviewed in the United States on January 29, 2024",Size: 10ftColor: BlackVerified Purchase,1,"The 10’ length is great when you need the extra cable so as not to pull or stretch in awkward areas where the extra length is necessary. The main reason for the this purchase is my new phone which has a “C” connector vs my previous which was lighting connection. I also purchased other Anker cables in various connector formats due to my upgrade including “A” to “C” cables for power packs, etc. This purchase was also 25% off for a quality braided cable with no charging issues. It was great to find the little velcro tie included which helps to manage the length of cable when necessary."
Michelle,5,Relaible Anker,"Reviewed in the United States on December 9, 2023",Size: 10ftColor: RedVerified Purchase,0,"Anker has always been my go-to brand for chargers, cables, and power adapters. They are reliable, high-quality, and well worth the money. This experience was no different than my others.

The braded cable is sturdy and thick, as a 10-ft cable should be. To my surprise, Anker included a little velcro cable tie in the box. I was pretty excited to see that since cable management can become a pain with longer ones. I worry rolling and weaving a cable around itself may cause damage over time, so this alleviated the concern a bit. Unfortunately, it did not last very long. I imagine it wore down a bit faster due to my handling and the braded material of the cable itself. It was still an extra touch not seen from other companies.

It works very well and I have had no issues with it. I was a little annoyed how every small electronic seems to be transitioning to USB-C, but at least Anker is around to provide the cables I need."
rick hancock,5,Great cord,"Reviewed in the United States on March 11, 2024",Size: 10ftColor: RedVerified Purchase,0,This cord is made well and gives me the ability to charge my phone while sitting somewhere that is a decent distance away from the wall.
Ryan Hoffman,5,"Lasted 18 months of heavy use, great value!","Reviewed in the United States on February 20, 2024",Size: 10ftColor: BlackVerified Purchase,0,"The cable (purchased 8/22) lasted about 18 months. I’m rough on my cables, so it was fully expected to wear out eventually. For the price, I consider this a great value!

Ultimately failed near one of the plugs, becoming very sensitive to orientation/pressure and intermittently disconnecting. This end of the cable got yanked on a lot in my setup (including awkwardly perpendicular to the plug) - if you’re more careful with yours, it could probably last much longer!"
chris,5,Great product by anker and I use it for everything,"Reviewed in the United States on March 12, 2024",Size: 10ftColor: SilverVerified Purchase,0,"Great cable. I mainly use this for my PC charger to another Anker 100W charger. I also sometimes use this for my ipad/iphone or other usb-c device. It charges everything and is a very multiversatile cable. You can get them in different lengths, but the 10ft one is good for laptop. If you get a Anker charger and use this cable it saves so much space compared to the laptop chargers that are huge and bricky."
bigcountrybaloo,5,Anker cables are always solid,"Reviewed in the United States on March 4, 2024",Size: 10ftColor: BlackVerified Purchase,0,"Anker cables are always my first choice when looking for a new cable to meet my needs. I bought this USB C to USB C 10’ cable to allow for charging my computer while working on schoolwork and to allow the cable to lay flat along the ground from the plug, and my 6’ cable didn’t accomplish that. It now lives in my school bag with my Anker GAN charger, so I or any of my classmates won’t be caught short."
Amazon Customer,5,Don’t worry about if your cord is long enough!,"Reviewed in the United States on March 10, 2024",Size: 10ftColor: RedVerified Purchase,0,"I like to read in bed on my kindle app and I love that I no matter which way I move I don’t have to worry about if my cord will reach my iPad, if I have it plugged in to charge. It’s also great when traveling by car because it reaches the kids in the back with length to spare."

McKool,5,"Anker USB C to C, 2.0 - Exceptional!","Reviewed in the United States on March 3, 2024",Size: 10ftColor: RedVerified Purchase,0,"I purposely purchased this brand and length for the Master Bedroom, where my wife has her iPhone and iPad. Anker is well known for exceptional quality, and this cable is a testament to that. The extra length was needed to snake from the outlet, up and around the bed, to give her the length to charge her electronics. Ahhh... Apple charging harmony!"
Vinay K,5,Great companion to the 120W charger,"Reviewed in the United States on February 22, 2024",Size: 10ftColor: BlackVerified Purchase,0,The advertised 65W PD charger of a power adapter didn't work on a recent flight to charge my MacBook. This cable along with the 120W Anker charger power adapter ( plugged into the power adapter portion of the above adapter ) pulled enough watts to charge my MacBook. A cable like this is needed along with the Anker charger. Don't buy the cheap no name ones.
Ed C,5,Well made,"Reviewed in the United States on March 12, 2024",Size: 6ft*3PackColor: BlackVerified Purchase,0,"I used one on my phone, it didn't work. Found out it was an issue with my phone. I'm going have it looked at in the near future."
P. Dugas,5,Excellent Anker Quality product,"Reviewed in the United States on February 22, 2024",Size: 10ftColor: BlackVerified Purchase,0,"I have been using Anker products for decades because they seem to make quality products that do what they are supposed to do. I use these cable with a 20Watt apple adapter for iPhones, iPads, spotlights, laptops, and every other electrical and electronic product that needs to be charged. I have never had issues with Anker."
mark,5,Works great for charging and not to bad for file transfer,"Reviewed in the United States on November 26, 2023",Size: 10ftColor: SilverVerified Purchase,0,"It's nice having a 10ft cable that's capable of 100 watts of power delivery, but it's only a USB 2.0 data transfer cable so your limited to about 480mbps data transfer speed. But for a durable cable that feels like it's good quality for about $10 your not going to get it all! Most of us these days need the higher power capability of a cable these days anyway. And if you need to transfer some files 480mbps isn't all that bad. That's 40MBps or 1GB in about 15 seconds. Which isn't bad for work files or some pictures. Now if your trying to transfer your entire phone contents that's 256GB like my galaxy S22 ultra then your going to go crazy waiting. But in that scenario your not trying to charge and your going to want a cable that can move data at the USB 3.2 rated speeds the phone is capable of, which would be a short 3ft long Thunder Bolt cable. To get fast transfer speeds the cable needs to be short and all your going to get from any computers USB port is 10 watts so all the wires needed to carry power are used for data which is fine because 10 watts is all a computer USB is going to give you anyway. So it really comes down to what you need.. data transfer get a thunderbolt cable and leave it plugged in to your PC, power delivery get a high wattage cable. Which USB 2.0 speeds are fine because it's only talking to the charger..."
Jon Campbell,5,C TO C CONNECTION,"Reviewed in the United States on March 12, 2024",Size: 10ftColor: RedVerified Purchase,0,"Had no dislikes, love the brite red it helps me find them a lot easier than black or gray"
Dunewolf,5,Works as advertised,"Reviewed in the United States on January 3, 2024",Size: 10ftColor: BlackVerified Purchase,0,"I was using some other cables prior to this and noticed the slow charge rates.. At the time I did not suspect the cable being the reason for longer charge times / slow charging rate.. but after some testing with shorter cables and some reading into how cable thickness and length plays a role in charging rates (ie speed) - I decided to order a long cable marked for higher power rating / speed - well cable has lived up to its status.
I still have the length needed to go from charger to my device while getting quick recharge times and even enough power to keep the device on while watching full length videos and still have power to charge battery. so if you need a longer range from your plug in charger - getting a cable built for the power/length is important. so getting this will help your charging speeds be higher while not having to sit so close to plug."
J.J. Malloy,5,Issa Cable,"Reviewed in the United States on March 11, 2024",Size: 10ftColor: BlackVerified Purchase,0,Needed a long USB Ccable. Got a high quality one. Is exactly what I ordered. No complaints

It worked great and after many months, I needed a new cable since my factory cable started to fray. I went back to Anker and bought some charging cables. They work just as great as their 20w block. Definitely like the Anker products. Good power, good quality and really, a good price."

GamePlayer,5,long Lightning cable. Work fine.,"Reviewed in the United States on December 25, 2023",Size: 10ftColor: BlackVerified Purchase,0,"Just do not bend them at the ends and treat the ends with care. Like all lightnign cables, they seem to break or stop working if the ends are ""flexed"" or twisted to any degree. Also, you need to take care not to pull the cord out or insert it into your device by any means other than a firm grasp on the hard plastic piece right next to the connector."

CyberSensei🥋,4,⚡️ The Ultimate Charge: Anker's 100W Nylon USB-C Cable Unleashed 🌟🌟🌟🌟,"Reviewed in the United States on March 9, 2024",Size: 10ftColor: SilverVerified Purchase,0,"In the fast-paced world of technology, staying powered up and ready to go is more than a convenience—it's a necessity. With devices becoming increasingly powerful and energy-hungry, the quest for the perfect charging solution becomes paramount. Enter the realm of high-wattage USB-C cables, a category where the Anker 100W 10ft Nylon USB-C to USB-C 2.0 Cable shines brightly. This cable isn't just another accessory; it's a testament to Anker's commitment to quality, durability, and performance, designed to meet the needs of the most demanding gadgets in your arsenal.

As someone who relies heavily on a range of devices for both work and play, finding a charging cable that can keep up with my lifestyle has been a journey filled with trials and errors. The Anker 100W cable, with its promise of fast charging and a robust build, caught my attention as a potential game-changer. From the MacBook Pro to the iPad Pro 2020, and even the Samsung Galaxy S20, this cable promised compatibility and performance across the board. My experience with it has been revealing, showcasing not just the strengths of Anker's design but also highlighting areas where even the best can improve.

### Key Highlights:
- **Robust Power Delivery**: This cable’s ability to deliver up to 100W of power is nothing short of impressive. It effortlessly charges my MacBook Pro 2020, keeping it powered through the longest of work sessions without breaking a sweat.

- **Versatility at Its Core**: The compatibility list of the Anker cable reads like a who’s who of high-end gadgets. From the latest iPad Pro and Air models to top-tier Android devices, this cable has you covered, making it a versatile pick for a tech-savvy user.

- 📏 **Extended Reach**: The 10ft length is a game-changer, offering the flexibility to charge devices comfortably, even when the nearest outlet is just out of reach. This extra length means I can use my gadgets in bed or on the sofa without being tethered too close to the wall.

- **Durable Design**: Wrapped in a new nylon exterior, the cable not only looks premium but feels built to last. It’s managed to withstand the daily grind of bends and twists without showing signs of wear, a testament to its durability.

### Areas for Improvement:
- **Stiffness**: While the nylon wrapping adds to the cable’s durability, it also introduces a bit of stiffness. This can make it a tad unwieldy to coil up or manage, especially in tighter spaces or when on the move.

- ⚙️ **Connector Size**: The USB-C connectors, while robust, are slightly on the larger side. This isn’t a deal-breaker, but it can be a snug fit in devices with closely spaced ports or when using certain cases.

### Summary & Recommendation:
The Anker 100W 10ft Nylon USB-C to USB-C Cable earns a well-deserved 4-star rating 🌟🌟🌟🌟. It marries power with versatility, all wrapped up in a durable and stylish design, making it an excellent choice for anyone looking to streamline their charging setup. While it’s not without its quirks, such as the cable’s stiffness and the size of the connectors, these are minor gripes in the grand scheme of things.

For tech enthusiasts juggling multiple devices or anyone in need of a reliable, high-powered charging solution, this Anker cable is a compelling choice. It’s a cable that not only meets the demands of today’s power-hungry devices but does so with flair and durability.

Thank you for considering this review. Whether you're looking to charge your MacBook, iPad, or any USB-C enabled device, the Anker 100W cable is poised to be a powerful ally in your tech arsenal, making it easier to keep your devices powered and ready to go."

It feels like a solid cable, and I like the braided look. I didn’t bother checking the data speeds, but it worked with everything I threw at it.
For the price, I’m happy with what I got. Honestly, if you need a USB-C cable that’s not too fancy but gets the job done, give this one a try. It’s worked well for me."

Nightsedge,4,A quality USB C cable from a well-known brand,"Reviewed in the United States on May 25, 2023",Size: 10ftColor: RedVerified Purchase,0,"Bought this cable to charge a Dell XPS 17 laptop via USB-C. Anker makes good products, and this charging cable has been no exception. It doesn't seem to heat up or be finicky in any way, though I have yet to charge it at 100+ watts or any extreme load.

My only 'gripe' is that the cable portion is a bit 'stiff' and the end connector is 'notchy' during insertion, but both will probably 'wear in' rapidly.

Like most of the rest of their products, this cable is highly recommended."
Ritu Niyogi,4,Great quality,"Reviewed in the United States on August 23, 2023",Size: 10ftColor: SilverVerified Purchase,0,Love the high quality braided nylon cable. I just started using it last week. But so far so good and hope that Anker lives up to it’s name 🙌🏼

John,4,"Great cable, but it smells so bad I don’t want to put it in my bag.","Reviewed in the United States on January 3, 2023",Size: 10ftColor: BlackVerified Purchase,0,"I don’t know if this is the Amazon warehouse’s failing or somewhere in the Anker supply chain, but the cable smells so strongly of mildew—think like your grandmother’s wet basement—that I don’t want to put it in my bag and have the canvas and liner of the briefcase take on that smell. It’s positively revolting. I’ve sprayed (read, “drenched”) it with Ozium which is a very powerful sanitizer and am letting it air out, but this is the second Anker product I’ve purchased recently with this issue. (Note: I’ve purchased a LOT of Anker products though; they’re my go-to for power and cabling.)

Figure this out, Anker/Amazon, because this is absolutely disgusting. It also makes me wonder if the connectors or chips inside of the connectors have taken on water at some point."

Amazon Customer,4,Doesn't charge at the Advertised rate,"Reviewed in the United States on April 29, 2023",Size: 10ftColor: BlackVerified Purchase,1,"Product claims to support up to 100 watts of charging, however I could only get 4 watts of throughput using an Anker Power port 65 watt charger.

The charger itself performs as advertised when using a different cable.

(Edit) Anker contacted me and sent me a replacement cable. The replacement charges at the advertised spec"
Engineer IndyJoe,4,Provides same performance as the OEM charger,"Reviewed in the United States on May 12, 2023",Size: 10ftColor: BlackVerified Purchase,0,Using this cable with a 100w charger I measured an equivalent wattage transferred to a new Lenovo laptop. Cable quality is decent although I’d prefer a vinyl or silicone sheath to a braided one.
Amazon Customer,4,This cable is great value for money,"Reviewed in the United States on November 22, 2022",Size: 10ftColor: BlackVerified Purchase,0,I received this cable and I was immediately impressed with the quality . The braided cable was done well and seems like it will last some time. It does support the 100w charging as long as you have a 100w compatible charging dock. I use an iPad Pro m1 12.9 and it was able to completely charge from 8% to 100% in a little over an hour with me using it. Highly recommend. My review is based on first impressions and my experience with product after one week.
Access Denied,4,The design quality and function of the cable is fine but.....,"Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2022",Size: 10ftColor: BlackVerified Purchase,0,The only reason I didn't give five stars across the board is because when I unwrap this it had obviously been sitting in a warehouse with less than optimal temperature control because it has a really strong smell of black mold it works fine but you guys better put a heater in the storage that these things sit in and some atmosphere drying bags because this is really hard to clean I had to use a sanitary wipe multiple passes to get it to smell moderately good.
Vanessa cox,4,Just one,"Reviewed in the United States on May 8, 2023",Size: 10ftColor: BlackVerified Purchase,0,There was only one cord and in the picture you can clearly see that there's supposed to be 2. It would be nice to get my other cord.
bwbaugh,4,Somewhat unexpected charging performance,"Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2022",Size: 3ft+6ft+10ftColor: BlackVerified Purchase,0,"Initial testing shows well under the rated 100w 😔, and the 6′ cable has lower throughout than both the longer and short cables 😕

Using the Anker 747 GaNPrime charger with the Anker 737 PowerCore 24K, the power bank reports the following with these cables:
- 3.3′: 74w
- 6′: 64w
- 10′: 72w

For comparison, the included ~2′ cable that came with the power bank reports 88w.

Build quality wise, the cable feels good. Unsure if the lower than rated performance is normal, but it’s odd that middle length cable seems worse than the rest. Maybe the quality varies from batch to batch. 🤔"

In a way, it is a get what you pay for sort of proposition. The 10 foot version of this cable only supports USB 2. I use this on a spare USB-C charger (also from Anker) on an iPad Pro (2021), works fine. The main thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars is that it is not USB 3 or 4. The 100W rating is a definite plus, though overkill for an iPad."

I've purchased two of these now and have been happy with both. I have one as a replacement cable for a MacBook Pro in my office and one for my iPad's side table in the living room. When I use either device plugged in, the cable is long and flexible and I don't worry about it as much as those tiny white Apple ones that start bulging at the connector in a couple of months if you'd don't treat them with the proper respect. Like most other Anker products, this one has met/exceeded my expectations so far."

If it was molded in the plug or was a grey less noticeable ink that would be cool. The white ink on the black plug just looks tacky. I always turn over the plug so I don't see it. My only complaint about an otherwise great and stylish cable. None of my other Anker cables have this gaudy logo. But nothing else compares so would definitely buy these again."

If you don't have a case or don't mind taking it off every time you use it, then it seems to work ok. Otherwise, DON'T get this one if you have any case on your phone. I can't talk about durability. I can't speak to durability, because I don't use it."

I enjoyed the cable until it started cutting in and out. The braided cable appears to be perfectly fine but the connection drops. I always roll the cable back up after using it for charging, perhaps it cannot be rolled and is therefore so durable, despite the braided cabling looking perfect? Disappointed it only lasted 6 months. The original Apple MacBook Air 2018 cable isn't braided, and it took 3.5 years before it started to have connection issues.

Ethan Schoonover,3,"Thinner than other 10ft, but that's an issue","Reviewed in the United States on August 10, 2021",Size: 10ftColor: BlackVerified Purchase,1,"Full disclosure: almost every charging cable I buy is from Anker. I settled on them long ago and have almost never been disappointed. That said, this is the first Anker cable I've had where I feel it could really do with some improvements.

I own a couple other 10ft usb-c cables I bought before Anker had released a 10ft c to c cable (Uni brand, not going to say you should or shouldn't get those instead since I don't know if they have maintained their quality over time, I bought those years ago). The Uni cables I own are pretty thick, woven cable sheath. Similar to this Anker cable but thicker.

It turns out that in a 10ft cable, thicker is better if you are going to be putting it away in a bag. Coiling it up and uncoiling it repeatedly means a thick cable won't kink up easily and will lie flat when unrolled.

This cable is long enough and thin enought that it unfortunately kinks up a bit. Not much! but even one kink when unrolling it is inconvenient and makes me concerned that over time this may result in some twisting or excessive wear of the cable interior.

I don't love how thick the other usb-c cables (the non anker cables) I own are. They've always felt... excessive. But I appreciate that they are heavy enough to basically never kink up.

YMMV, but let this be food for thought. Anker, if you are listening, I'd prefer to see these a bit thicker or less kink prone."

The new replacement cable arrived, but the cable is also super smelly. This one is slightly fainted but still strong chemical smell that's never happened before.
I followed up with Anker on their support email, but I'm having a bad feeling that other newly manufactured products would have the chemical smell as well...

Original:
I have multiple cables at home from this exact listing. Most of them arrived great but the most recent one arrived with tempered box and super smelly cable that I've never seen before. Called Anker and it's NOT normal (maybe Amazon did the ""return as new"" thing again). They'll take care of it by offering me an exchange.

Beside that, everything else is good. Anker's product is pricier than average so that's why the value for money only got 4 out of 5 stars.

Sean,3,"Great length, not as durable","Reviewed in the United States on April 12, 2022",Size: 10ftColor: BlackVerified Purchase,0,"While the nylon cable is significantly longer it's not nearly as durable as Anker's powerline series. I purchased this cable a year ago and it already has enough wear on it to where it's no longer charging properly, in fact some devices won't charge at all. The cable now has to be plugged in on specific sides instead of either side, which defeats the whole purpose of the USB-C's design and a certain end needs to be plugged into the phone and the cable itself has to be angled perfectly in order to charge. While I recommend this for the length I do not recommend it for heavy use, if you're willing to sacrifice length for durability I highly recommend Anker's powerline series of C cables as I've bought my powerline cable 2 years ago and it's still working perfectly.

TL;DR This cable is not durable enough for heavy use, the Anker Powerline cables are."

I had it plugged in overnight so didn't pay much attention until I noticed the battery indicator change color.

EmbeddedFlyer,2,"Has compatibility issues with multiple laptops, stiff, bulky, Anker FAIL","Reviewed in the United States on November 2, 2022",Size: 10ftColor: RedVerified Purchase,0,"Anker has, in the past, been among the best brands for cables and chargers but they seem to have lost their way. I have various laptops and other devices that charge with USB C and this cable only works with about half of them while Anker's earlier cables work with all of them. What's going on Anker??? You're going backwards.

Even using this cable with 3 different Anker PD chargers, it refuses to charge one of my M1 Mackbooks, two of my Dell laptops, and my 12 inch M1 iPad Pro. Using a 2 year old Anker USB C cable with those same chargers and laptops works perfectly.

And this cable is very thick, rather stiff, and just not very user friendly. It doesn't coil up well for storage and it doesn't like to lay flat when in use. The stiffness also puts extra stress on the USB C port of whatever device it's connected to. And the USB connector itself has rather high insertion force compared to most cables which also will likely stress the USB port on your device.

The issue isn't how much current this cable can carry as, using a USB C power analyzer, it can deliver 60+ watts to devices it's compatible with. It appears the issue is how it's wired/configured as some devices just refuse to charge with it.

Anker needs to do MUCH better. They're charging a premium price for a clearly inferior product."

UPDATE 11/9/2023: for the last month or so, when I plug my computer in using this cable, it will initially connect, and then intermittently disconnect several times, sometimes once, sometimes 10 times. It happens in 3-5 second intervals. This is especially annoying if my computer is almost dead. My trust of Anker products so steadily declining. Another example: I got a phone charger cable that started to fray on one end after a few months use. I will be hesitant to buy more Anker products if this is where there quality is headed."

Only the branding and superficial qualities (cable sheathing, colors) separates one from the other. I still went with Anker because they used to have the best customer service out there and stood behind their products.

After this cable died on me after one year, I went through the warranty process to get a replacement. After jumping through multiple hoops, sending a bunch of pictures, reiterating the same information already provided etc, I destroyed the defective cable per instructions and waited for a replacement. When it came I opened it up to find they sent me an obviously damaged, used cable in a taped up box.

I’ve just about had it with Anker. I paid the upcharge versus their competitors for the knowledge they had the customers back. No longer the case. I’ll save my money next time and just toss the cable when it inevitably dies."

Jacob Birmingham,1,Lasted maybe a month,"Reviewed in the United States on February 22, 2024",Size: 10ftColor: BlackVerified Purchase,0,"I’ve had a lot of luck with other anker products, but not their 10’ c-c cable. Very flimsy. Had about a week out of the box before it became flimsy, then once flimsy it had to be plugged in at a certain angle in order to charge anything for about 2-3 weeks. Doesn’t charge anything now. Hopefully just a 1 off, but doubtful given the cable encountered minimal wear and tear throughout the duration of its life cycle."
Sam,1,Nylon thread comes apart after a few months,"Reviewed in the United States on December 5, 2022",Size: 10ftColor: BlackVerified Purchase,0,"Update 12/2023 lowered to 1 star:
I bought this cable originally one year ago. After 5 months of use the Nylon Brading threads started to come loose right under the plastic ""plug"" and eventually could see the wires. Bought a new cable in August. Now 4 months later this cable is doing the same thing.
It says it withstands over 12,000 bends. That is simply not true. After 8 months of use on the first purchase, and the 5 months after the 2nd purchase, both have had the same problem. Poor manufacturer and can't get a warranty replacement.

--------
Update: after about 10 days the manufacturing smell is finally gone from this Anker New Nylon 10ft USB C cable, so I was able to use it with the Samsung 50W charger next to my bed. Overall the build quality seems good and my Note 10+ recognizes the Fast Charge 2.0. Overall my main issue was the initial toxic smell from the cable when you take it out of the box, and took about 10 days to dissipate.
--------
Original review:
I have used different Anker cables for years, but this New Nylon 10ft cable is the first one that I've used that has a strong toxic smell right of of the box. I couldn't use it to charge the phone next to my bed due to this toxic smell. I put the cable in another room and even outside and days later it still has this bad smell. I guess it's from whatever material is used during manufacturing. But after a week, I decided to return it and get a different Anker cable which is more like a rubber/silicone cover, but has no bad smell to it."
Neofocal,1,Not a 5A/100W cable. Voltage drop and cable resistance are greater than allowed by specification.,"Reviewed in the United States on November 26, 2023",Size: 3ft+6ft+10ftColor: BlackVerified Purchase,0,"Section 4.4.1 of the USB-C Cable and Connector Specification states that the maximum permissible IR voltage drop on Vbus and GND shall not exceed 500 mV and 250 mV, respectively. At 5A drawn on Vbus, this implies that the total cable resistance of Vbus and GND must not exceed 150 milliohms.

The measured cable resistance of Vbus and GND for the 10ft cable is approximately 200 milliohms, which would be fine for a 3A cable, but not 5A.

The measured cable resistance of Vbus and GND for the 6ft cable is approximately 190 milliohms, which would be fine for a 3A cable, but not 5A.

The measured cable resistance of Vbus and GND for the 3.3ft cable is approximately 185 milliohms, which would be fine for a 3A cable, but not 5A.

Very disappointed in Anker, these appear to be 3A cables with e-mark chips installed."
Notned,1,"Was a very good cable, when it worked","Reviewed in the United States on December 16, 2023",Size: 10ftColor: BlackVerified Purchase,0,"I own several Anker products, all of which I have had no issues with. This cable, however, only lasted me about 4 months.

The problem I get with my cable is this intermittent charge. Whenever I use the cable to charge my Pixel 6 it charges for a second or two and stops, repeating this for as long as the cable is plugged in; my phone screen turns off and on due to it being in a state of charging and not charging.

I know it is the cable because when I use other USB C cables with the same charger and phone, they work fine."
BK,1,From 5 stars to 1 star,"Reviewed in the United States on September 12, 2023",Size: 3ft+6ft+10ftColor: BlackVerified Purchase,1,"Originally, didn't use it for much fast charging nor heavy load.
But recently tested it with Samsung S23 Ultra, then the problem just show up right away.
With Anker's own Prime Serie charger or Nano II, both show the same issue.
The issue will stop and reconnect the phone almost every 1% charged or every 1 min or so.
Therefore it won't stay connect.
I have a review updated for the charger. Prime 67W, originally I blamed the charger for it, because I tested with all 3 cables from this, and expect correct result. Man I am wrong.
Once I used another brand 100W cable, issue solved with the charging issue. So this Anker cable seems not supporting the power or such? No idea, we will leave it to Anker to explain to us.
Now this cable is useless because it can't stay charge to my phone."
Stephen L.,1,Terrible quality,"Reviewed in the United States on October 27, 2023",Size: 10ftColor: BlackVerified Purchase,0,"I bought Anker because I read it was supposed to be the best. My wife and I went through four of these (shame on us for being dumb enough to keeping buying them) but each failed after only a few months of use. I've never had a charge cable and cube be this big of a pain in the neck. They either connect disconnect on their own like the connection is loose, or they flat out don't charge. What a waste. I'll never buy another Anker product again."
W. Kitchens,1,Died in 2 months,"Reviewed in the United States on December 23, 2023",Size: 10ftColor: SilverVerified Purchase,0,"Super disappointing to pay a premium for the Anker brand, only to have the cable die in less than 2 months. Not charging my iPhone 15 Pro anymore (other cables work fine). Cable was just on my bedside stand the entire time, so it wasn’t even subject to any rough use. Not buying Anker products again—their quality has clearly declined and it is no longer worth paying their inflated prices."
Ryan,1,Stopped working after less than a year.,"Reviewed in the United States on November 17, 2023",Size: 10ftColor: BlackVerified Purchase,0,"I bought this cable along with two random lesser known brands. I expected the Anker to outlast the other two cables, but it started having issues after about 6 months and completely stopped working after 10 months. The other two are still going strong.

I should also note that this cable was never bent or tightly wound.

Really disappointed that this didn't last longer."
Edwin Davy,1,My cable only passes 5W of power,"Reviewed in the United States on June 21, 2023",Size: 10ftColor: BlackVerified Purchase,0,Bought this cable to charge my Asus Ally via a battery pack. Paired it with the Anker 737 as I wanted 100W of power in order to run the Ally through a dock at max power. I then bought the Anker GaNPrime wall adapter that outputs 120W of power. When I use this cable into the power block to charge it from the wall adapter I only get 5W however when I use the cable that came with the 737 power bank I get 92W. Through this deduction I can confidently say that either A. I got a defective cable or B. This cable is not rated for what is being advertised. Returning and buying a different cable.

I'd have to play with the cable for like 2-3 minutes every time I plug it in before it will maintain a consistent charge. First Anker product that has been such a disappointment.

Karen,1,Terrible musty odor!,"Reviewed in the United States on October 12, 2022",Size: 10ftColor: BlackVerified Purchase,0,"I have several of this cable and they have performed great! With the discounted price on Prime preview days I ordered another. I have many Anker products and never an issue to date. This one smells of a strong terrible musty odor. I will wait 24 hours to see if the odor dissipates and if not this will be going back! It appears to me that Anker may have changed the exterior of this cable at some point which may contribute to the odor. Whatever the case it’s intolerable at this moment.

Update: the odor hasn’t dissipated at all - in fact the area of the house I placed it to air out now also smells terrible when I opened the door! It’s getting returned. I would caution anyone that is sensitive/allergic to avoid this product! Clearly cutting corners on quality which raises red flags for their other products going forward."

I bought it to replace my UNI cable that I'd been using for years had started bending. I bought this because of the so called fast charge. I put it in a fast charge pd outlet and this cable did not fast charge anything I put it to. I even changed pd ports and tried another pd outlet and still way slow like a normal cable. NOT A PD FAST CHARGE CABLE. I contacted Anker and they wanted all kinds of information for a replacement. I ended up getting a refund and bought from a seller who carried the UNI brand cable which is super fast and a great long lasting cable!

hunter,1,Thought anker would be different,"Reviewed in the United States on August 12, 2023",Size: 10ftColor: SilverVerified Purchase,0,"Been an anker user for a long time. Had a lot of accessories.

This one disappoints me. Start malfunctioning after a few months."
Jamey H. Owens,1,Typical Garbage,"Reviewed in the United States on September 4, 2022",Size: 10ftColor: BlackVerified Purchase,0,This cable is worthless. Less than a month before failure. USB-C cables in general seem to be utter garbage. I've bought so many the last year and they all break internally or at the plug or bind up in their own covering. Give me just one company who doesn't make trash and they'll have my loyalty.
Danny,1,Faulty cable,"Reviewed in the United States on July 7, 2023",Size: 10ftColor: SilverVerified Purchase,0,Cannot charge my 2023 MacBook Pro 14inch. It switches between not charging and charging constantly. I do not experience this issue with the provided MagSafe charging cable.
Jason,1,Do not buy.,"Reviewed in the United States on July 4, 2023",Size: 10ftColor: BlackVerified Purchase,0,Wore out quickly. Cycles power on and off when charging my phone now. Anker products have taken a down turn in quality in my experience. Would not recommend.

Cat_in_a_box,1,It Killed My Phone!,"Reviewed in the United States on October 4, 2022",Size: 10ftColor: SilverVerified Purchase,0,"The first time I plugged my phone into this cable using the original power brick that came with it, my phone died. Nothing else on the same surge protector was affected, just my phone. Now I'm out $900 to replace my phone all because I trusted the Anker brand. DO NOT BUY!"
Isaiah Livensparger,1,Item does not work as stated,"Reviewed in the United States on December 23, 2022",Size: 10ftColor: BlackVerified Purchase,0,I have supported Anker for 10 plus years and this is the first item to not work with ANY items. All C port devices are unable to be charged. I am sad to say this might be the last item I buy from Anker.
Kel,1,Stopped working.,"Reviewed in the United States on July 19, 2023",Size: 10ftColor: SilverVerified Purchase,0,Several months in it just completely stopped charging my phone. Useless product if it can't even last 1 year.

normalguy,1,Mold covered,"Reviewed in the United States on October 5, 2022",Size: 3ft+6ft+10ftColor: BlackVerified Purchase,0,The cables and box showed up and stunk like mold/mildew. When I pulled the cables out of the box you could feel the mold on the outside of the cables. This isn't the first time I've purchased anker cables but it very well might be the last.
George,1,Stopped charging after a year,"Reviewed in the United States on June 30, 2023",Size: 10ftColor: BlackVerified Purchase,0,"My phone is fine, other cables work. Very light use, only used by the bed every other night or so."
Benjamin Garbe,1,Does not work with Samsung Note 20U,"Reviewed in the United States on January 4, 2022",Size: 10ftColor: BlackVerified Purchase,1,These cables worked fine and Super Fast Charged my Samsung Galaxy Note 20U for a few weeks with the original Samsung charger. I thought I just had one bad one and switched the charger but then a few days later the next one went. When I plug it in is says that it is unrecognized and will not charge the phone.

Flippers,1,Failed in 6 months,"Reviewed in the United States on April 12, 2023",Size: 10ftColor: RedVerified Purchase,0,"Purchased in late October, failed in mid April.

D.M. Beverly Hills,1,Arrived musty moldy,"Reviewed in the United States on November 20, 2022",Size: 10ftColor: BlackVerified Purchase,0,"Never again with a braided Nylon cable. This arrived moldy/musty and could not air out. Couldn't even sanitize with alcohol, so straight into the trash. Aside from that issue, I had no opportunity to try the product."
skeyhani503,1,1 DOA-Dissapointing!,"Reviewed in the United States on April 13, 2023",Size: 3ft+6ft+10ftColor: BlackVerified Purchase,0,Ordered these & 1 was DOA. Anker is supposed to be tile but a dud from the get go isn’t a really good sign!
AJ,1,Does not stay connected to macbook,"Reviewed in the United States on May 5, 2022",Size: 10ftColor: SilverVerified Purchase,0,"it will plug in and make a sound that its charging but then will continually disconnect and reconnect. Very annoying. It's absolutely not usable with macbooks unless the one i received is just defective?

Doesn't reliably fit on
2019 16"" Macbook Pro
2021 13"" Macbook Pro"
Chelsey,1,"Got cable in April 2022, already quit working","Reviewed in the United States on September 14, 2022",Size: 10ftColor: BlackVerified Purchase,0,"Loved this cable until today when it stopped working. My S22+ alerts me that something foreign is in the charging port and to remove it immediately. Does not charge anymore. Nothing has changed since I bought the cable, same charging block."
venkat Esh,1,Not durable,"Reviewed in the United States on July 1, 2023",Size: 10ftColor: SilverVerified Purchase,0,Lasted just a month. Keeps disconnecting when I charge my phone.

New W.,1,Not good quality,"Reviewed in the United States on June 14, 2022",Size: 10ftColor: BlackVerified Purchase,0,"Had to return this Anker charging cable because it kept putting my ipad on sleep mode. How do l know? I used my old C cable, that still works fine, and no problems. Must have got a bad cable from Anker. Buyers beware!"
changen pan,1,Dead after 3 months,"Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2022",Size: 10ftColor: SilverVerified Purchase,0,Decent cable but doesn't last. Has similar or perhaps worse durability compared to apple oem. It might be better to have a harder/uglier strain relieve on the ends rather than have it look nice but break after a few months.
Margi,1,Stopped working after a half dozen charges.,"Reviewed in the United States on March 18, 2022",Size: 10ftColor: SilverVerified Purchase,0,"Stopped working after a half dozen charges. I did not abuse this cable. I had it plugged into one place and use it only there. But tonight, it died. Unfortunately, I didn't use it often enough to be able to return it in the return window."

hannon,1,This does not pass through video.,"Reviewed in the United States on February 26, 2023",Size: 10ftColor: BlackVerified Purchase,0,"Make sure you just need to charge, if you actually try to connect a computer to a monitor this is not the cable for you."
Amazon Customer,1,WARNING!!!⚠️,"Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2023",Size: 10ftColor: BlackVerified Purchase,0,Warning!! Do not get if your charging block doesn't have the shiny end that looks like exact same part as you put in your phone
Jenny,1,Stopped working after only a few weeks.,"Reviewed in the United States on June 30, 2022",Size: 10ftColor: BlackVerified Purchase,0,Anker has always created great products. This one stopped working out of the blue. No kinks in the cable. Always taken good care of it. Buy at your own risk here. It's not durable at all in my case.
lilia garcia,1,Never worked.,"Reviewed in the United States on January 26, 2023",Size: 10ftColor: SilverVerified Purchase,0,"Great looking just the size I needed, hooked it up and nothing. Tried a dozen different electric plugs
Nothing - dead!! Never worked!!!!"
Amzcustnh,1,"Didn't last long, only normal use","Reviewed in the United States on May 1, 2022",Size: 10ftColor: SilverVerified Purchase,0,"About 5 months after buying this usb c charging cable it stopped working.

Only normal use with plugging and unplugging every few days.

Not a sturdy cable. Thought Anker was supposed to be better quality, but it is not."
Dale W. Pittman,1,Stopped working after light use,"Reviewed in the United States on January 8, 2023",Size: 10ftColor: SilverVerified Purchase,0,I have had two of these. Each one stopped functioning. Under light use. Anker has been my go-to brand. I think I may be done with Anker.
Matthew S,1,Can't even charge at 60W,"Reviewed in the United States on November 30, 2021",Size: 10ftColor: BlackVerified Purchase,0,Using together with an Anker 100W PD charger on a Thinkpad X1 tablet. The tablet constantly connects and disconnects from the power source. Other cables I've tested with on the same charger don't exhibit this problem.
Chris,1,Does not work well with my macbook,"Reviewed in the United States on April 28, 2022",Size: 3ft+6ft+10ftColor: BlackVerified Purchase,0,Constantly stops charging for a few seconds on my macbook pro. Very annoying... I can confirm that its not the macbook or chrager that is the issue. A different cable charges the macbook completely fine.
