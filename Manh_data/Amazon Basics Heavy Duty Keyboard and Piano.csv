S. Huang,5,"Wired, Steelseries Arctis 5 Review","Reviewed in the United States on July 3, 2019",Color: BlackStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,"After vacuuming up the cord of my very old Razer Cacharias (?) headset, it finally declared its death when my Discord group mentioned I was cutting in and out, and so it was time to replace my headset. For a very terrible 3 months, I bought a discount headset with plasticized ear cups, and while I could hear and communicate, it was very uncomfortable. I was looking into other Razer alternatives but didn't really feel as if their features were as interesting as the Steelseries, and I also had a few recommendations for Steelseries from others. Attach to it RGB function (my tower is needlessly fluorescent) and I decided to plop down the funds for this wired version. I've never been a fan of wireless, just something about connection and not having to worry if the wireless is up in a clutch moment is just my style.

The headset is very stylish. I'm a small person, with an average size head and average but slightly pokey-outey ears. The fabric and the stretch fabric on the headset is very comfortable and breathable. It angles just a touch forward when I wear it, which is not noticeable after a few minutes. The retractable microphone works very well, and my raid leader says I'm very crisp - definitely not the case with my knockoff cheapo headset.

Length of the plug leading from the headset to the dial toggle is very generous, as well as from the dial toggle to the computer. Due to USB hogging I have to use the top of my tower USBs, but no problem at all, very forgiving in length. I haven't had it fall out yet but I'm not headbanging while raid healing. The dial toggle is very cool! I can use it to easily mute out game noise if there's an issue, or vice versa if everyone is just talking about nothing and I want to tone them down. At neutral, it's equal for both.

RGB functionality is initially a bit complicated looking but is through Steelseries' app that you can download, and you can make separate profiles. I have a violet/blue shifting thing for my Tauren Shadowpriesting and have several other profiles - glowing gold for my paladin, green for druid, etc. And there are sound function toggles.

Sound is great, crisp, and no reverb at all. The surround function at least in World of Warcraft is excellent and positionally is usually great, although for some reason sometimes when I'm mounting up on a specific mount the sound will originate more to the left, but, this isn't always, and maybe is a function of my setup.

I especially like this for Youtube progressive house mixes, bass turned up! The noise cancellation is not really cancellation, but the muffling is enough that it takes out more ambient noise. I live by a freeway though, so there's nothing killing that noise. Definitely softer.

I really like this headset. I would recommend if you're in the market, give this a good try, I hope mine has a lot of life left in it. It's a lightweight headset and the cords are fairly lightweight but give you great range.

Also a good wow factor, if anyone is watching you game, and I can make it match my tower RGB, hah hah. The little things, eh?"
Annie,5,Solid budget headset,"Reviewed in the United States on March 1, 2024",Color: BlackStyle: Nova 3Verified Purchase,0,"A rambunctious pug broke my husband's headset and he didn't want to get a new one with our newborn on the way. This headset was a pretty good price. Used for PC gaming. We were surprised by it's sound quality, comfort and mic quality. Decent headset for price."
Terry Riner,5,"Another victory, another Steel Series","Reviewed in the United States on December 19, 2022",Color: BlackStyle: Nova 3Verified Purchase,0,"The best price to performance wired option for spatial audio and competitive gaming.

The Good:
Works with every device via 3.5 (aux) or USB.
Plenty of included cord length.
Great noise-canceling mic
Exceptional Almighty spatial audio (the highs, mids, and lows are all very present and accounted for).
Excellent build quality.
Durable and easily adjusted.
Customization: Leds and EQ tunings using the software on PC.

The Neutral
At this price a wired headset should include a case, stand, or something—anything really.
The bass is average when not using custom preset on PC and it's lacking over 3.5.
The 40mm Steel Series drivers (like all their headsets) would all be better if they were larger (50mm).
It's average at cancelling other noises around you (ie busy traffic, barking dog, etc.)

The bad:
Usb and internal DAC as well as LEDs don't work on Xbox. (You can plug up the USB wasting a port just to get the lighting, but why?)

You might as well buy the Arctis Nova 1's if you don't have a device to take advantage of the USB connection. If you have multiple devices and most (or the primary) can use the USB, then this is the best option (at this price point).

If you want Hi-Fi audio, then the Arctis Nova Pro Wired is what you want (probably the best cans I've owned that's both decent at scratching the audiophile itch and delivering exceptional gaming audio―everything just sounds better!)

For wireless there's the new Nova 7's which are great, but if you want to have two systems hooked up simultaneously I highly recommend the Nova Pro Wireless.

I love the new Nova lineup, but I do believe SS needs to start offer larger drivers, include more accesories, or charge Less. I will be reviewing the Nova Pro as well.

Thanks for reading!

Thanks for reading this quick review"
E.J.,5,Great headphones for great price👌,"Reviewed in the United States on September 13, 2023",Color: BlackStyle: Nova 3Verified Purchase,0,"Waited till they were on sale (50% off) to buy and was not disappointed in quality! It's got the cords for diferent platforms but I usually play PS5 online shooter games, so being able to hear other players/npcs foot steps sneaking around me is a must and with these I can hear exactly where they are before they get too close. Mic sounds clear and the cushions muffles a decent amount of sound from outside (have to lift one side off if someone is talking to me in the room to hear the words lol). They are also soft enough to keep on your ears for hours of gaming or listening to music if you wanted without feeling discomfort, the head strap is a nice touch for extra comfort. I really can't find anything wrong with them so for the price and quality I definitely recommend! Just watch the volume cause I almost blasted my ears off when I first tested them out😂"
April,5,Good sound quality for gamers,"Reviewed in the United States on January 25, 2024",Color: BlackStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,"I gifted this to a friend as I know he's really into the gaming scene. He said the sound quality really helped to improve his experience (he said it was easier to hear footsteps in game). He also mentioned that it has a software that helps to customize sound experience and has a few presets for the games he likes to play (like VALORANT). He can lower sounds that he doesn't want to hear and elevate footstep sounds. He also likes that it has a really long wire so he can walk around to get things while playing. From what I've heard, it doesn't really help with noise canceling but he wasn't looking for noise canceling so it worked out. Overall a really great purchase and he's still using it after a year."
Jacob L.,5,Wanted To Wait A Few Months Before Writing This Review,"Reviewed in the United States on July 22, 2020",Color: BlackStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,I was recommended this brand of headphones. I loved the face that it had RGB lights on each cup. I am a RGB fanatic. I pulled the trigger on the wired ones. I didn't want Bluetooth especially for gaming. I love how long the cord is. That is awesome. Now I def don't like the type of connection that goes from the DAC to the actual headphones. Its a unique type connection. As for sound quality these are amazing. Especially in COD it sounds like you actually there. For music it sounds awesome. Now def download the software. And def turn on 7.1 Surround sound. These sound horrible with out that on. They sound like tin cans. Equalizer is really good. I love that you can boost up dialogue and bass. Great for music. Not so great for video games. As when you boost the bass video games gets drowned with bass. My issue is how flimsy sometimes the connection to the actual headphones are. Theres times where I move my head and the connection seems to go in and out. Audio sounds far away. But just a tight push and it works with no issues. Idk it could just be me but I dont know how these are rated as the best mic in gaming. Im sorry but I have heard ASTRO headphones that are 30 bucks sound better. I def use a Condenser XLR mic. I dont use the mic on this headset at all. For the price I paid I def like these. I would buy them again. And honestly I would recommend these to anyone.
Jon,5,"Great headset, shite software","Reviewed in the United States on September 14, 2023",Color: BlackStyle: Nova 3Verified Purchase,1,"I just got this, for me personally out of my 5 headsets I've had in the last 3 years this is the best, light and comfortable, ok-ish customisation in the gg software, not many preset sound modes, but smiley worked best for me, coming from steel series arctis 5, arctis prime and skull candy slyr pro this for me is the best I've had.
Insane directional audio, layers of in game sounds and music is amazing.

10/08/23
wanted to update, this headset is set apart from others with the software, unfortunately the gg software is so massive and resource intensive it made my 7900x/32gb ram pc unplayable on any game, unless steelseries trims and optimizes their software dont bother with their headsets"
Tristan,5,Incredible software and the cleanest looking headset I've owned.,"Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2024",Color: BlackStyle: Nova 3Verified Purchase,0,"After owning the headset for a few months, the only hiccups I've ever had regarding it was with the RGB. The software wasn't changing the colors for a while, but when I got around to fixing it I just had to tweak a few settings to fix it.

With the cons out of the way, this headset are by far the best I've ever owned. The unboxing experience was very memorable, the design of them are perfect, and it's the most comfortable headset I've had the pleasure of wearing (especially with my glasses on). And that's not even getting to the audio and software. The software that you download to adjust the headset is literally a must have if you want these to sound their best, but when you download it you'll be in for a surprise.

The software itself comes with almost anything a gamer could want from it. There's clipping software that's actually really good and efficient, there's giveaways they host for different games, and even an aim trainer for competitive gamers. The audio itself isn't noticeably better than any other headset I've used, but with the software it's able to achieve new heights. This easily blows any other headset out of the water that I've used in the past."
Carol,5,They're great,"Reviewed in the United States on March 12, 2024",Color: BlackStyle: Nova 3Verified Purchase,0,Bought as a gift for my boyfriend and these did not disappoint. They're comfy but the cables without an extender the headphones came with might be too short for some people's likings

Very comfortable too. It doesn’t provide sufficient noise cancelling, so don’t buys these with those kinds of expectations. I don't really care about noise cancelling, so these work perfectly for me"
Jake,5,Better than $250+ options from other brands,"Reviewed in the United States on October 9, 2023",Color: BlackStyle: Nova 3Verified Purchase,0,"After buying 4 other $100-$280 headsets from big ""gaming"" brands this one is by far the best. Sound is very well tuned for most games without any EQ needed. However the SteelSeries GG Sonar software is by FAR the best I have used for peripherals. Only downside is they do advertise their other products on it, but id rather have that over the bugs and glitches that plague other companies software. As far as the mic goes its not the best I have heard on a headset but for the price no complaints. However you are able to make it sound pretty good using the included mic EQ setting in Sonar."
CeejayPanduh,5,The new era of steelseries,"Reviewed in the United States on September 6, 2023",Color: BlackStyle: Nova 3Verified Purchase,0,"Upgraded from my primes to these thinking it was gonna be a downgrade but WOW what a switch up! The configurable EQ on this is really good, i have IEM quality sound in a gaming headset. Its really light with a completely improved design so i know it wont end up snapping from regular use like the primes did, comfort is about the same but thats ok since steelseries headsets are all top tier comfort. The wire is prolly my favorite improvement next to the AI noise cancelling mic it has, no more stupid knob on my desk and i can finally fine tune my voice without any professional setup. Extreme quality and options for gamers here.

Rating: 11/10 a new era begins here"
justus,5,Buying again in future,"Reviewed in the United States on October 16, 2023",Color: BlackStyle: Nova 3Verified Purchase,0,"First things fist, I'm a simple man okay. Anyways, these are some comfy *butt* headphones. Using the elastic head band is much easier than sliding the ear cups to the right place, just to have them eventually need to be adjusted over and over again. Next on the list are the ear cushions, they are idk how to say it...""THEY'RE SO FLUFFY!"" They feel like pillows. And finally the cherry on top, the mic is easy to adjust and stays in place. Things I don't like about it, the wired headset part.

That's it."
James Festa,5,Great quality,"Reviewed in the United States on January 11, 2024",Color: BlackStyle: Nova 3Verified Purchase,0,Good price and a good product
Austin,5,Best bang for your buck,"Reviewed in the United States on October 7, 2023",Color: BlackStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,"I've bought 3 pairs of the Arctis 5, one for me and a pair for each of my two brothers as a present. I recently upgraded to a pair of Artics Nova Pro Wireless and it solidified how awesome these are for the price (especially when you can get them on sale). The sound quality is awesome and the mic quality is probably as good as some stand-alone streaming microphones if you tune it well in Steel Series GG.

All in all, if you're looking for a solid gaming headset you really can't beat this for the price."
Marine,5,LOVE IT!,"Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2023",Color: BlackStyle: Nova 3Verified Purchase,0,From all thr headsets I've use for gaming these are ny far the best I've ever bought. Mic is crisp and clear. Volume is absolutely amazing. It comes with so many different cables for different uses. It fits beautifully and doesnr hurt mu ears at all. I've definitely become a fan of steelseries and would recommend it to any Gamer out there! Run dont walk and buy this product NOW you won't regret it one bit.
Bob,5,SteelSeries New Arctis Nova 3 Multi-Platform Gaming Headset,"Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2023",Color: BlackStyle: Nova 3Verified Purchase,0,Just what I was looking for. Some headphones are hard to wear because they start hurting my ears. But these from Steelseries are the best so far. Not too expensive but has features that I always looked for.
Chase Wilkinson,5,"Quality, Comfort and Looks","Reviewed in the United States on June 9, 2023",Color: BlackStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,"Exactly what I wanted!
Can't express how pleased I am with my new headset. I was using the Arctis 7 for the past 6 years and tried to upgrade to the wired pro, which was nice but right out of the box the mute button was oversized, not supported correctly, making it stick and not work. I tried the Logitech G Pro, but didn't like the feel of them. Then I found the Arctis 5 wired, which has all of the same quality, sound and performance of the Arctis 7 ""including the mute button"". The enhanced features are the light weight comfort of the headset and the Game/Chat dial is at my finger tips instead of on the back of the head set. I also love the added lit illuminating feature on the headset, it pairs perfect with my illuminated Razor mouse and keyboard. Very happy with this purchase"
Carlito Lopez,5,Good headset for the price,"Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2023",Color: BlackStyle: Nova 3Verified Purchase,0,I got the headset for a friend who has tmj pain from wearing headsets like I did but these ones have pivot on the earcups like my astro a50s to keep the pressure off the jaw
Manuel Carballo,5,Nice product for young kids,"Reviewed in the United States on December 27, 2023",Color: BlackStyle: Nova 3Verified Purchase,0,Works good for my 9 year old boy. PS4. can connect via usb.
NopeNope,5,Honestly tArctis' best headset.,"Reviewed in the United States on May 13, 2023",Color: BlackStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,"I've had this headset for 4-5 years and just bought another to replace it once it wears out completely.

I've also tried many of Arctis' other headsets, including the newer ones and none of them fit like this one does. I have a big head and all the newer versions of their headsets are too small, or put pressure in the wrong spots on my head, or the ear cuffs are too small and don't fit my ears.

I'm going to be real sad once all the Arctis 5's are gone, because they haven't made anything that measures up to it in terms of comfort since. I've tried Logitech's that has the similar headband style and I might have kept it, but the sound was garbage in comparison.

I just keep going back to my worn out Arctis 5 because it's still better than any new headset I can find right now."
Julian Johnson,5,Quality,"Reviewed in the United States on October 25, 2023",Color: BlackStyle: Nova 3Verified Purchase,0,Bought on sale and not disappointed. Use it to play games in house before my five kids are up. Sound quality is great on it and I like how the mic is retractable so you can use it when needed instead of it always being there or unplugging mic and losing it.
Alexandra W,5,3 Cheers for SteelSeries,"Reviewed in the United States on March 31, 2022",Color: WhiteStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,"This gaming headset is everything for me! I use it exclusively for PC gaming and love the dial that lets me change sound focus from browser/game to voice chat. It's really helpful during gaming moments where I don't have time to manually go into the game settings and lower the sound so I can hear instructions or callouts for fights in Final Fantasy XIV.

I also have a Elgato Wave 3 mic and I can still use the game/chat dial with the Elgato Wave Deck program, it just takes a little fiddling with. Ease of use is so great though!

The sound quality is not too bad, the only place I've noticed any dip in quality is with music. It still sounds good, but not quite as good as a Razer headset. The functionality of this headset supercedes that one teeny flaw for me.

Noise cancellation is pretty good too! There are dogs that live in the home that constantly bark when their owners are away, for hours at a time, and these headphones are the one thing saving my sanity from the incessantly borking doggos.

They wear so easily and are comfortable on my head. The velcro band at the top can be adjusted to fit probably any size head.

If you're even considering getting this headset, just do it. Please, just do it. Thank me later!"
kristal lopez,5,Good quality,"Reviewed in the United States on December 4, 2023",Color: BlackStyle: Nova 3Verified Purchase,0,"These headphones work so well with the ps4. Audio is loud and clear, and I play a lot of FPS games. Audio is a must while playing FPS."

If you like wired over Bluetooth it’s an amazing headset, the wire doesn’t really get in the way but I ran into the issue that the aux adapter sounds terrible(mic) on ps5 but the usbc works well."

Amazon Customer,5,Most comfortable headphones I’ve used,"Reviewed in the United States on August 4, 2023",Color: BlackStyle: Nova 3Verified Purchase,0,"Ive been hunting for the most comfortable headphones, and I think I’ve found them. I’m on my computer a lot for work and am prone to headaches, so the weight and suspension band are perfect combo for me for long wear use. These are some of the lightest headphones I’ve seen on the market. The sound quality is great, if not a tad quiet, and the built in microphone is pretty solid compared with my Yeti snowball. For the price, I’m not sure I could find a better product."
Tyler Moore,5,Great multi-platform headset,"Reviewed in the United States on July 10, 2023",Color: BlackStyle: Nova 3Verified Purchase,0,"I bought this since my old steelseries mic started making a static noise in the game. This time I went with wired since I didn’t like having to charge the old one. Sound quality is great happy it comes with different cables. I use the usb c to 3.5 cable on my switch and usb c to usb c on my PS5. RGB is cool if your into it, I don’t think you can control the colors with consoles only pc so it’s default is rainbow color cycle. Overall happy and it was an Amazon deal price so saved 20 bucks."

When I play with my brother's they say that they could hear me clear and that I didn't echo when I would talk to them. When I play by myself I like to listen to music and the music sounds really good. It has a some bass in it when your listening to music. But If I had to rate this 1 out of 10 I would give it 9.8.

Eduardo Diaz,5,"Great Audio, Super Comfortable!","Reviewed in the United States on June 30, 2019",Color: BlackStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,"These is, by far, the best headset I have ever gotten. The audio quality is amazing, and they are very comfortable to wear. After purchasing a horribly tinny and uncomfortable Logitech Headset that used the same surround sound tech as this one, I was expecting to be met with the same issues that caused me to return those. To my pleasant surprise, the audio quality on these things are amazing. The ear cups have nice acoustics, allowing for the audio from the speakers to be delivered to your ears with complete clarity while blocking out noise. And while talking about the ear cups, I'd like to mention how pleasant they are to wear. They create a nice barrier from the outside while still being breathable and soft. They don't create an air tight seal which sucks on your ears like leather cups, and they don't feel cheap or itchy like most cloth cups I've had the displeasure of wearing. The head band adapts nicely to the size of my head without needing to fumble with extensions or straps. It rests on your head snuggly, so you can look around without worry, but no so tight that it causes any sort of discomfort.

As important as comfort is, the main concern regarding all headsets is audio and audio quality. You won't be disappointed with these! Just out of the box, they deliver amazing audio quality across the spectrum, and by enabling surround sound in Steelseries' software, you get clear and immersive surround sound which delivers concise positional audio. The microphone also delivers great clarity, with the audio quality coming close to most consumer end dedicated mics.

I definitely recommend this headset for anyone looking to game or chat. They look nice, sound great, and feel good. I'd go as far as to say that they're a steal at $99.99."
Tiffany,5,Amazing headset!,"Reviewed in the United States on February 21, 2023",Color: BlackStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,"I bought this for my brother who is extremely picky about his headsets. I've had to return two sets of headsets because of it. It took me months to find him the right headset. He wanted a headset that had a quality mic or audio with incoming quality sound on the headphones as well. This type of headset is not so easy to find when it's a USB cord. USB cords aren't known for the best audio or sound quality. This is the best headset I've found. He hasn't complained at all about it. He's only had good things to say about the headset. If you're looking for an inexpensive headset, with high-quality features, and a USB cord then this is definitely the best headset you can buy hands down."

nobody,5,"Super comfortable, great sound quality, relatively easy to set up.","Reviewed in the United States on October 22, 2021",Color: WhiteStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,"I'm so glad I decided to just shell out the extra money for a good headset. Steelseries engine has preset equalizers. one is Flat, one is Voice, they sound like shit, as expected. but man, when you set the equalizer to Music? shiiiiiiiiiiit. these things sound incredible when you have some spotify blasting. just out of the box they sound good. but downloading the engine and trying different presets is nice.

they're also super comfortable. the velcro makes it weird trying to find the right fit but it only takes 2 minutes of fidgeting around to find it. if that. the earpads are crazy soft and squishy, they feel great. I wear glasses too. no problem. they might feel weird at first, you just have to find the right fit with the velcro. they sit on your head and around your ears so seamlessly.

the mic is basically what you would expect from a headset. it doesn't sound incredible but it's good for what you pay for. it's better than most i've heard.

has a volume scroll wheel on the left ear to raise or lower your volume. very nice.

its great, buy it."
Darya,5,Love it so much. Perfect for any gaming platform.,"Reviewed in the United States on March 12, 2023",Color: WhiteStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,"I’ve had this headset for around 2 years now and it’s still going strong. Outlasted every other headset that I’ve ever had. This headset has good sound and microphone quality. I would recommend this headset even if you have a console like me, just plug it into the usb port in the back of your console and you’re good to go. However, if you have a console, the game/party audio scroll wheel doesn’t really work for anything other than lowering down the volume of the headset, which is why I don’t use it, I think this is more of a pc feature. But overall this headset is great and looks very aesthetically pleasing as well."
Caio G.,5,Amazing!,"Reviewed in the United States on June 5, 2020",Color: BlackStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,"I previously had a cheap headset for gaming/music that I kind of used universally. It worked fine and I got out of it what you would expect out of a cheaper headset. I decided to upgraded to the Arctis 5 for better quality in both gaming and music and I have not been disappointed. They are so amazingly comfortable, and easily capable of being used for long periods of time without hurting your head or ears. The ear cups are very cushioned and the head band feels like the band of ski goggles. As far as fit goes, they're amazing.

The sound quality is very good. I was impressed at how good it actually was. I'm no audiophile, but these sound amazing. If you download the steelseries engine software, you can customize preset profiles for gaming (and even for specific games) and music, where you can adjust the equalizer to personalize your sound. That same software is where you can control/personalize the RGB, which is purely aesthetic, but still looks cool. I've got different settings for music and gaming and there is a notable difference between the two.

I would definitely recommend this headset to anyone that is looking to upgrade. I'm sure there are discrepancies for audiophiles but if you're looking for an upgrade to a good headset, this is a really good choice."

NR,5,Nice Gaming Headset,"Reviewed in the United States on November 11, 2022",Color: BlackStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,"I needed a replacement for my old, worn out headphones and this gaming headset seemed to check all the boxes in what I was looking for. It's very comfortable and lightweight and I love the ear pad cushioning. It's plug and play, so the software isn't necessary, however, you'll need it if you want to tweak around with the RBG lighting and other configurations. The mic quality is clear and I like that it's retractable for the times I don't need to use it. The only thing that I've noticed and agree with the other reviews is that the sound is not as loud as I would have expected, but it's not that big of a deal. Overall, it's a great gaming headset and worth the purchase."
scradam,5,"Really comfortable for all day wear. Also functions as earmuffs for hearing protection, I guess.","Reviewed in the United States on January 9, 2021",Color: WhiteStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,"I bought a pair of these for both my wife and I about 8 months ago. We both love them. We use them for music, gaming, Discord, and work team Skype/Zoom meetings every single day. They are extremely comfortable for all-day wear, and the ear pads won't break down easily, even after months of wear. After working from home and wearing these every day for great lengths of time, they still feel like new. Very very high quality.

My only problem with them is that they basically act as shooting range earmuffs as well. I can barely make out anything my wife is telling me from ~7 feet away with these things on. On the upside, the volume being pumped through the headphones can be kept rather low and your ears can be preserved because everything else becomes so silent by comparison. If you live/work/play somewhere you want to block out noise without true noise cancellation, I suppose these are pretty good. If you want to hear what your family is saying while you have these things on, it could be a small problem."
Mohammad F.,5,"Modern, Comfy, Incredible sound","Reviewed in the United States on March 15, 2023",Color: BlackStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,1,"Headset looks and feels great. Love the retractable mic and simple controls. I also love how the mic glows red when you activate mute. After a few youtube videos looking for optimal settings and adjustments and software downloads I was able to hear footsteps from opponents in Valorant even when teammates were clueless. A real game changer and very comfortable. For this price I consider it a steal. Only complaint I have is the fragile feeling and looking wire which I was able to manage correctly, however I wish it had a little more premium feel to it. The added knob for control is a great plus and looks good mounted onto my desk."

Andi,5,Like Magic,"Reviewed in the United States on June 12, 2020",Color: BlackStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,"I have never had such a good pair of headphones. The sound quality is crystal clear. I'm hearing sound effects I never knew were in my games. They have amazing 360 degree sounds so you can hear sound from all directions in a game, especially the location of enemy footsteps.

The sound quality is so good that it rivals a studio headset for listening to music. Sounds are vivid and not compressed.

The noise cancelation is so good that I can't hear a single sound, not even my own voice. A plane could probably crash in my kitchen and I wouldn't hear it. The setting that plays your voice back for you through the headphones is required if you're talking to anyone, as you can't hear yourself.

The microphone is amazing. The adjustable distance lets you set it to the perfect range. My friends have no issue hearing me and it sounds like I'm in the same room as them. I especially like the red light on top that lets me know that I'm muted.

The wires are a little too long for my liking. It takes some weaving it around behind my pc to get it to a reasonable length, but it's okay.

Overall, these are amazing."

Vini,5,Best bang for your buck! 8.5/10,"Reviewed in the United States on May 3, 2020",Color: BlackStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,"It's pathetic how negative the comments for these headphones, as well as 90% of other gaming headphones, can be and how inaccurate they are. READ IF YOU ARE PLANNING TO BUY THIS HEADPHONE.

The pros and cons BELOW...
The sound quality is absolutely amazing, you can FEEL the sound vibrations and high quality it produces. The Steelseries headphones, this one, comes with a software you can install to customize your headphones, both physically and the audio engineering side of it; you can turn the bass up, down, completely customize the EQ.

The comfort of these headphones was a big deal to me, they are the only headphones that I can wear for 6+ hours in one sitting and feel like they're not even there. The comfort is ridiculously amazing with these headphones, so on that, I give them 10/10.

The catch is...the Steelseries software is a complete joke. Every time you turn on your computer to use these you have to unplug and plug the headphones back in if you want the full 7.1 surround sound feeling. Trust me, you'll feel a HUGE difference on how amazing it is when you feel the full potential of these headphones. But it's frustrating and ridiculous to have to do this EVERY SINGLE TIME you turn on-and-off your computer. If you don't do this, then you'll just get the basic quality the headphones delivers (which is still VERY amazing)."

Jonathan H.,5,Look and Feel Great..,"Reviewed in the United States on March 18, 2019",Color: WhiteStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,So they look amazing nice a sleek and even feel comfortable too. Size adjustment on them is not the best the adjusting of the headband is kinda annoying being it doesn't stick well sometimes but overall if you can get past that it fits and feels great even for extended computer times. Only real issue I had was the volume they dont get very loud you have to use windows loudness or another program to boost them but overall sound quality is nice and and they have a full sound to them. You may have to tweak them some in the equalizer to get them where you want them but overall nice sound and the lighting on them is subtle its enough to add the extra flair and RGB to your setup with out being over the top or distracting and clunky looking. Build quality is great they are light and made with decent material so they feel like the real deal vs some slapped together pair you would usually see around the price point. Overall they get a solid 4 out of 5 from me the slight noise that gets through and the sound not being as amp'd as I like is why but overall I would recommend them to anyone looking for style and color to there setup.

Kylie,5,Stylish and Comfortable,"Reviewed in the United States on January 14, 2022",Color: BlackStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,"Hardware: This is the most comfortable headset I’ve ever worn and being able to hide away the mic when not in use is a plus. I like that the dial to adjust the level between game/chat and the volume control are used by physically turning them. The mic lights up when it is muted, which is nice but does cause a little glare on my glasses. It’s a minor complaint all things considered.

Sound: The driver software is easy to use, and I like that there are both preset options and individual controls to adjust the sound to the use case. I keep it on the music setting most of the time. The mic picks up really well even when I speak softly. I wouldn’t call these noise-cancelling, but it dampens outside sound enough for my uses."

Ralph Matthew Santiago,5,A great value!,"Reviewed in the United States on July 2, 2020",Color: BlackStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,"Hi! I got these to replace my turtle beach headset which is just getting old from usage. I use my headsets daily for hours so I feel I could definitely give a proper review.

Pro:
Great Noise cancellation. And mic noise cancellation.
Best mic I've used in a while. (I've gotten alot of feed back from my voice chat regulars saying I sound very crisp.)
RGB lights are fun and cool but the mute red light on the mic is very useful too! Practical not only ascetic.
Super comfy fit and cushions.

Cons:
If your looking for absolute noise cancellation, this isn't that, you can still hear some noises around you.
Mic is very clear to the point where my buddies hear me breathing haha! Just make sure to adjust and test the mic.
One size with adjustable ski band, this fit large on me so I dont have much room for adjustments.

This is a great value for the price your technically getting a headset id value at 150 to 175 with surround sound and very quality sound."

T.C.,5,Super comfortable headset with great microphone,"Reviewed in the United States on July 8, 2021",Color: BlackStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,"I can’t say how well these work for gaming but when teaching online classes they are amazing. I teach online classes on some days for 8-9 hours and all the business headsets I was using were uncomfortable after the first few hours. I can wear these all day without any ear or head pain.

In addition to teaching I create educational videos for our university and the other headsets had a background hiss when recording the audio in Audacity. The Arctis 5 headset does have the background hiss and does a great job of removing the noises in my home when recording.

I have a large head with big ears and these fit perfectly. The wire connecting me to the computer provides plenty of room allowing me to stand and move without feeling tied to my chair."
Trevor Lea,5,"Comfortable, feature rich, and they sound excellent.","Reviewed in the United States on May 23, 2020",Color: WhiteStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,"I love this headset. The positives, the speaker and mic audio quality are top notch, has a mute button and volume on the headset, retractable mic, a volume balance knob for chat and game (if using Discord or a similar app), LED lighting, and they are super comfortable. The only negative is after wearing them for hours the can cause perspiration around the ears. However, this isn't unusual for a gaming headset. The headset also comes with an adapter so it can also be used with a standard 3.5mm audio/mic jack like on a phone.

Once of the coolest features of this headset is the chat / game balance control. This was I can easily adjust the volume of my teammates versus the in game narration, sound effects, or whatever. Very helpful when playing an RPG like FO76 and you want to hear the characters over other folks in the Discord channel.

Finally, the software is stable and integrates other SteelSeries products together, like my MSI laptop keyboard. No complaints."
Carrie,5,"Great buy, solid headset","Reviewed in the United States on January 20, 2021",Color: BlackStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,"Got these in yesterday. This is our second set, not because they broke but because our new kitten chewed the chord. Had the first set almost a year and my daughter games daily. So far this has been her favorite brand, and we have been through loads!
Sound quality is amazing, after talking with her friends, they said the quality of the microphone was spot on. I think the only thing that would make her happier is if I had managed a wireless version. As far as durability, my daughter is 16 and frequently plays horror games. It has held up to the screaming although I can’t say the same for my ears. She is home schooled so used it with her computer as well for videos and chat and has no issues with it.
I would recommend this product if you need a good solid headset that doesn’t cost an insane amount of money."
taylor dginto,5,Great price for fantastic headset,"Reviewed in the United States on July 28, 2019",Color: BlackStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,"Now I'm sure there is someone more suited to write a tech reveiw but I really love this headset. For the price this is the most comfortable headset I've ever put on. I'm 4' 11"" so as you can imagine I have a hard time finding things that are of good quality AND don't make me look like a child playing dress up. The slim form not only looks good but still sounds amazing. The cherry on top here is the headset also doesn't look like it was made for a child. When my fiance wears them they look just as good on him (if not better.)

I don't play too many games with directional sound but my fiance has told me they are as good as his Razor headset (not sure of the model but identical to the white ones worn by Pewdiepie). I do however listen to a lot of music and play a few games and the immersion is always amazing. The adjustable audio app is really cool as well though I haven't explored it fully yet.

All in all I love this headset and would recommend it to anyone.

MCG,5,"Works well, easy setup, good sound","Reviewed in the United States on June 30, 2020",Color: BlackStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,"These are lightweight, comfortable and easy to use. Mute telescoping microphone is nice, and mute button right on the left ear is a plus. The wire got a little lose for me and I thought they had broken (it was cutting between stereo and mono), but the wire is removable and it had just gotten pulled out a little. I plugged it all the way back in and it was fine.

This set is the only USB headphones I have that aren't at MAX volume all the time in Windows 10, which is a HUGE plus. I had given up on USB headphones in Windows 10.

The only slightly odd thing is that the inline volume knob is backwards. You turn it counter-clockwise to turn up the volume and clockwise to turn it down - counter to every other volume control I've ever seen... But that is a minor quibble."

Some nice features are the retractable mic, volume control behind the ear, and the knob to control game over voice volume ratio. I also like that these headphones can either be USB or headphone jack compatible. I haven't really tried using the wireless feature of the headphones. So i don't know how good they are in that department. I think the only negative is i wish the adjustment straps were a bit different. I personally don't like the design of them as they can come unattached easily. Despite this, i've been using these headphones for quite a while now and I love them. I use them for everything I do online. They're comfortable and the sounds quality is great. These are exactly what I needed."

They are comfortable and they are very good priced for what you get. My only real complaint is the implementation of the Chat/Game Dial, I absoloutely hate this thing. I accidentally move it which makes my volume lower, and there should just be a software override for this thing. It would be much better if it controlled perhaps windows audio (while there is a hardware volume wheel on the headset) and I just found that i just uninstalled the arctis5 game audio and it just fixed that, but regardless other than that, good headset for anything really good balance great for music."

That being said, I guess it's true; Don't judge a book by its cover. Having them for awhile they are great.
The headset is made out of a high grade plastic that is light weight that you can wear for hours and I mean hours without feeling discomfort. The pads fit around the ears perfectly, the sound is crisp, and the microphone is heavenly as my discord buds said. I can say with the noise cancel my son sat by me for awhile didn't even know he was there until he yelled HI DAD!
The adjuster strap is a thick, soft and contours to your head. Took me about 5 mins to make it perfect.
Make sure you download the software. It enables you to adjust praticly every sound setting you can think of.

Suspension bands are a must to stop the top of your head from hurting for after long game sessions. The mic slides in and out easily and has a nice bright LED letting you know you are muted forwhen your mom starts to tell at you to go to bed late at night. Cables aren't braided but are high quality tangle free and super long. Steelseries engine works which is nice.

Cloth earpieces, not my first choice, but, these were fairly comfortable, at first.
i prefer a bigger ear piece, one that doesnt press against my hear , but covers it entirely.
a bit too tight on my head as well, after a short while, it was getting uncomfortable.

mic quality is good, as these are one of the better wired headsets out there.

but, i couldnt keep them as the comfort factor on them was bordering on painful after about an hour of gaming.
sound is really excellent. very crisp, and i have tinnitus bad ( ringing in the ears ). had they had a better ear piece design, i would absolutely have kept them.

SO.. if they fit you or you dont mind a bit of a more secure fit, these will do you well. one of the best sounding of the 4 headsets i bought to try out.

build quality is very good, look and feel solid, given their price point, as good as some costing a good deal more, and sound just as good.

recommend if you dont mind a bit of a snug fit, both against your head, and around your ears.."
Primal,4,Just One (Big) Issue,"Reviewed in the United States on March 16, 2024",Color: BlackStyle: Nova 3Verified Purchase,0,"I got these for $44 used.. The rating was very good with a trusted verified seller. I can't tell if it's a lemon and why it was returned. Perhaps it's because it's used or perhaps it's an issue with the headphones themselves. However it'll often just start screeching loud static every once in a while. The only way to fix it is to disconnect the headphones and reconnect them. While it's not a huge deal... it is annoying to have incredibly loud/harsh screeching in your ear periodically. It usually only happens make 5-10 times a month, but still not what you want from headphones.

However the sound quality is good, but most wired headphones are just superior to wireless in sound quality. I have a $400-500 wireless headphone set that was vastly outperformed (sound quality wise) by a $100+ Philips Audio Fidelio X2HR . If you can get that for $75 or less I feel it's a better deal than this headset at $44. However for $44 this has good sound quality. The mic isn't the best, but it works fine. I bought it because my work headset was causing weird issues. Lesson learned... more money doesn't always mean a better result.

If you're seriously looking for a headset for work or gaming I'd recommend looking for a wired headset in the $100-200 range. You don't need a more expensive one and at the $100+ mark you're less likely to be hit with a cheaper build to justify the lower price point. However if you want a headset for $50 or less this is a decent one used. Just remember that buying used/refurbished you can get issues like what I did. You're always rolling the dice even if the odds aren't too bad. More like rolling snake eyes to end your run."
Zane Stuemky,4,"Great headset, incredibly confusing software","Reviewed in the United States on March 2, 2024",Color: BlackStyle: Nova 3Verified Purchase,0,"I love the headset. Everything sounds great and the mic is very crisp, but the Steelseries software makes it very confusing to use. It’s best to just turn off sonar, which makes everything just not work.

There is also a minor problem I have with the mic, where when I first use it, only static comes out (I tested this with my friends). To fix it you have to unplug and plug back in the headset and it’s fixed. Not a big issue and easily fixed, but kind of annoying having to remember to unplug and plug back in the headset every time I get on.

Amazing quality, just a few quirks that make it a 4/5"
david,4,Great other than the cable,"Reviewed in the United States on February 1, 2024",Color: BlackStyle: Nova 3Verified Purchase,0,"i was looking for a headset to use between my computer and xbox and landed on this one. they are soft on the ears for longer gaming sessions.

Gaming: you can hear everything in your game or movie. you can turn them up loud with out them popping

Noise cancellation: i cant hear my dog bark, my wife get mad at me or my kids complain its great.... until you take them off and get in trouble with everyone.

Sound quality: if you use the 3.5 cable it crackles unless you flip the USB-c cable i know it doesnt make sense but it works. when you twist the 3.5 it just keeps crackling you have to turn the cable around.

it comes with both usb and 3.5 cables, the 3.5 connection cable is very flexible and moves easy. the cable with the USB connection is pretty stiff gets twisted/ tangled very easy it also sits funny on your shoulder."

Robert Valdovinos,4,"Surpasses General Use - For Niches, however, It's a Mixed Bag","Reviewed in the United States on September 27, 2019",Color: BlackStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,"I got this headset hoping to upgrade from my ASTRO A10 headset.
Generally, there are more benefits than there are drawbacks.

While the headset audio quality is nowhere near that of ASTRO gaming, the Arctis 5 headset audio quality gets the job done

The microphone quality on the Astro A10 headset is mediocre, but the Arctis 5 build-in microphone quality and muting functionality are superb.

While the ASTRO A10 headset is bulky, durable, and very heavy, the SteelSeries Arctis 5 headset is comfortable, light, and disadvises any heavy-duty handling.

The product promises 7.1 Digital Surround Sound through its surround sound simulator software ""SteelSeries Engine 3"".
The software offers terrible ""surround sound"" as it just hampers the audio, so I just leave it off.
However, the software is more useful than most people review!
It offers a wonderful equalizer, microphone volume tuner, RGB-lighting earcup customizer, and microphone sidetone (which lets you hear yourself as you talk in the mic; it isn't ideal but it's there if you want to use it)
(I recommend the following equalizer settings:)
(62.5 = 4.1) (250 = 1.9) (1K = 0) (3.6K = 1.7) (12K = 1)

If there are two things that the Astro 10 headset does considerably better than the Arctis 5 Headset, it would be providing surround sound capabilities and in-line volume control.

I play a lot of shooters, and it is much easier to determine where sounds are coming from in the 3D digital space with the Astro A10 headset than the Arctis 5 headset.

The in-line volume control on the Astro A10 headset is more rigid and secure, while the volume control on the Arctis 5 left earcup is so sensitive that even picking up the headset would be enough force to turn the volume control wheel.

The delicacy of the game-chat audio mixer is ludicrous; just about any amount of force could turn the mixer wheel!

Finally, the way that the earcups on the Arctis 5 can turn inwards but can never outwards is a little disappointing as this headset has some serious personal speaker potential with its volume capabilities.

Now for my most favorite part of using the Arctis 5 headset! The Arctis 5 headset is great for listening to music!

This headset comes with two ports: the custom mini-USB and the 3.5mm audio jack ports.

I love that I can be able to 3.5mm Bluetooth Adapter, and it becomes a wireless headset!
It doesn't have the best audio quality, but this is a major upgrade from the Astro A10's incompatibility with anything less than 5-pole 3.5mm audio jacks in the earcups.
Granted that you also have a headset case, you can take the Arctis 5 headset and a 3.5mm Bluetooth adapter on the go!

You can wear these for much longer periods of time than any Astro headset, which is always a plus!"

A m a Z O n F r e a K,4,"Good, software troublesome","Reviewed in the United States on June 7, 2023",Color: BlackStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,"OK, here we go!

Pros:
Great Fit
Sound is good
Just plugs right in with ease

Cons:
Software is not good. Too many choices, which in turn makes your game sound like crap.

Overall:
Great headset, but out of the box and plugging in is a nightmare. I had one of my gamers get the same headset and he also said the software is quite cumbersome to the point of uninstalling it. Basically in a nutshell, I plugged the headset it and navigated to the windows settings to adjust ambient sounds, etc., done, works as expected after that change.

Good luck getting these to work unless your a rocket scientist and can sit in front of the software for hours, purely ridiculous whomever developed this sorry excuse for sound control.

Have fun!"
Amazon Customer,4,good but with a quirk,"Reviewed in the United States on August 18, 2023",Color: BlackStyle: Nova 3Verified Purchase,0,"as mentioned this is a good headset, the sound is clear, the glow effect looks as one would expect giving a nice ambience, and the mic can be tucked away when not in use, sadly i had trouble with the mic picking up sound when there was non present and constantly making issues, luckily it seemed to go away after a while messing around in settings but im not sure how i fixed it so i cant say for sure. still a good buy for the money you pay."
Kindle Customer,4,Pretty good for beginner gaming headphones.,"Reviewed in the United States on November 6, 2023",Color: BlackStyle: Nova 3Verified Purchase,0,I rather get these kinds because it's well made.
John,4,"Fantastic, but lets in a lot of outside noise","Reviewed in the United States on July 28, 2021",Color: BlackStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,"These are great headphones. The audio is great, and my buddies say my microphone it a lot better than the earbuds I used to use. Plus the RGB lighting matches my Corsair build, even though you can't really control the headphone color with the Corsair software. I wasn't expecting to, so this is perfectly fine. These headphones have a great minimalistic design that I love.

The pads around the ears and headband are very comfortable and breathable, much better than some other models that don't let your ears breathe and allow things to get humid.

There is a volume knob wired into the cord about halfway between the headset and USB connector. I wish this came with something to stick the knob to my desk or tower. If I move around, sometimes it will fall and the knob will twist after contacting something, either reducing the volume of game chat or the game itself. I wish the knob had a stronger detent in the middle to prevent unintentional adjustments.

Also, when you mute your mic, a red light comes on at the tip of the mic. It is very bright. You can overcome this by retracting the mic into the headset (which is a neat feature) but you can still see the light in your monitor reflection if it is dark in your room. Sort of annoying, but you get used to it.

Lastly, for some strange reason, outside noise seems to be louder when wearing these. I have two mini fridges (beer cooler and wine cooler) in the same room as my PC and I can hear them louder with these on than when I take them off. I really can't explain it - maybe the headphone housing unintentionally amplifies these noises?"
Hunter,4,Good quality but some minor issues,"Reviewed in the United States on September 25, 2023",Color: BlackStyle: Nova 3Verified Purchase,0,This is a great headset and I've loved the features that come with them. Only issue with them is the USB C cable that plugs into the headset sometimes unplugs while I'm using them which is a bit annoying but tolerable.
Black Blade,4,Great headset the lights are a little too much,"Reviewed in the United States on January 2, 2022",Color: BlackStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,"I got the SteelSeries Arctis 5

I do love the headset its gives good sounds and good options from its settings
The dangle allowing to make chat or game take more over the sound than the second one is great and the option to disconnect the cable from it makes it really easy to pick up and take away with my laptop

I would have rated it 5 stars however the mic led to allow me to know if the mic is active or not that is great, however, is too strong making it really stick out on calls where you can see my left side shine in red color as well as it floating my eye when the mic is out (not pulled back into the headset), and there is no option as much as I was able to find to control it (turning the led on or off by choice) and its the main reason for the 4 over 5 stars

Besides that the mic works well the headset comes in a good box with 3 cables 1 headset to the proprietary cable ending and from there can go into the Chat/Game dangle with a longer cable into the USB of the PC or a shorter cable that turns to a 3.5 connection that is great if you got a Mic/Speaker connection on a phone or laptop

I world recommend this headset over all

7.1 personally its the first one I got that claims it, and I did not feel it so far, after installing the software and all the rest"

Dave Piston,4,Arctis 5 Wired Headset,"Reviewed in the United States on April 4, 2021",Color: BlackStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,"After researching wired headsets for a while I finally decided to give the Arctis 5 a try.

Lets start with the bad first:
Volume wheel feels cheap and loose (but does work well)
Hard to hear yourself even when you've maxed out the Mic Sidetone
Wires are super long which may be a downside for some. (My cat likes them a little too much)

Now the good:
Super, SUPER comfortable! Can't imagine a more comfortable pair of headphones. The strap is genius. Perfectly spreads the weight of the headphones over your head without any pressure spots and it's easily adjustable. The ear cups are made of cloth and memory foam which is great if you're like me and you hate leather or faux leather against your head (don't know if they can be washed but I'll have to find out). Besides the general comfort of it they also don't make you overly sweaty during long gaming sessions and because they're cloth it doesn't make a perfect seal against your head which can cause headaches from the pressure against your eardrums. The MIC is retractable which is a convenient feature and it's simple to adjust it to the perfect position. Everyone I've gamed with has stated the voice quality is good to great. Aesthetically they're simple and tasteful looking with a little bit of bling and eye candy with the configurable LED light rimming each ear cup. Sound quality appears to be pretty good for a roughly one hundo pair of headphones.

Besides a few minor quibbles the Arctis 5 wired headset is overall a VERY comfortable, decent sounding, nice looking pair of headphones for the money."

Amazon Customer,4,"These are great headphones, for the average gamer.","Reviewed in the United States on March 19, 2019",Color: BlackStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,"I was a bit skeptical at first when I first purchased these because of the differing reviews. Some totally hated this headset, and some praised them for being the best in the market. I decided to take the chance and buy them. When I received them I was scared of them being a bad headset. After taking them out of the box and plugging them into the USB port on my Playstation (which is what I use them on), I could tell that the sound was pretty decent for $100. I noticed that it sounded a little tinny but it seems to be going away after a week or two. It isn't that loud of a headset so if you prefer headphones that make your ears bleed than these aren't for you, but I don't need super loud headphones. The surround sound is pretty good and noticeable too. The mic is pretty good, I wouldn't say it is as good as advertised, it definitely isn't ""The Best Mic in Gaming"". The mic is good though and should be perfectly fine for gaming with friends. Now let's talk about the negatives. The biggest problem I have with the headset is that the cords are a mess and unnecessarily long. I also think they should get rid of the ChatMix dial because I don't see a purpose in really having it, also it is very sensitive so a little nudge will adjust the dial and possibly turn your game sound off. Another thing I don't like is that the ear cups are really shallow and the speaker is usually touching your ear which can sometimes get a little uncomfortable (although the head strap is really nice). The last thing is not the headphones themselves but the way they are advertised. These are advertised as the most high-quality headset on the market, but it is really just another average headset, they really hype it up for more than it is.
Pros
- The sound is pretty good for the price
- The mic sounds really good
- Pretty good surround sound
- The RGB lights look AMAZING
- Pretty convenient buttons
- Head strap is pretty comfortable

Cons
- Cords are a nightmare
- ChatMix Dial is kind of annoying
- Not very loud (really not a big deal)
- Ear cups really shallow"
tyler bruno,4,Solid Budget Headphones,"Reviewed in the United States on February 12, 2020",Color: BlackStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,"Hey all, so I'm not too experienced in this field of the market. I had a hand-me-down pair of Turtle Beach X12's that lasted for around 12 years (they don't make em like they used to/Discontinued 🤔🤔)

I really enjoy these so far. They seem more flexible than the pair of headphones I have for my xbox, same manufacturer as above, though a much more over-designed model. Obviously, flexibility is not critical to the product but to my mind it will go a long way towards extending the longevity of this headset.

Sound Quality, I am hardly an expert on. When I listen to music, I can hear a deeper depth (more tones or even ""instruments"") than I would with say... stock speakers. This is a huge plus to me. That factor is what I like about headphones. As far as gaming goes... when I think of gaming headsets I think of ""footsteps,"" as considered in shooter games. The only shooter I seem to have played so far while owning these is Insurgency Sandstorm.
I think the directional quality of the sound is as good as can be expected for ~$60 dollars, maybe even better.
I know that after several rounds I am slightly keyed up and or shaking from the immersive quality of my gaming experience. I remember the gun sounds as excellent, whether this is from the game or headphones I'm unable to discern.

I would recommend these to a friend.
In a very subjective sense I like them better than I might have liked a highly branded pair. 🤟

Amazon Customer,4,Great headphones for the price.,"Reviewed in the United States on September 2, 2021",Color: BlackStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,"Pros:
-Excellent sound for gaming and music (for the casual music listener, that is)
- Wonderful EQ and features built into app
- So dang comfortable, could wear them for long sessions without them becoming a factor
- Cups are soft and durable. Material doesn't peel.
- Party/Game audio knob is convenient.
- FPS gamers will enjoy the accurate audio cues.
- Clean appearance, fun RGB customization options.

Cons:
- For best audio, you can't wear most gaming glasses or a ballcap. Explained below;
If you wear anything that might lift the top of the ear cup from your head, you will compromise the low end of your audio. The cup MUST rest against your head around your ear, else your sound will be tinny.
- Can't find a very convenient location for the adjustment knob, it sort of just floats around my desk. (Hardly inconvenient, more of just a silly observation)
- Not ideal for console gaming, as you lose the all-important audio software, and must manipulate game/party volume through the console.

Another plus to mention, the mute light on the mic is super clutch (though it does not work when using headset with console).."

S. Swanner,4,A very solid headset with some quirks,"Reviewed in the United States on June 16, 2022",Color: BlackStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,"I've owned this headset for several years now. It's been a pretty consistent experience.

Pros: Quality sound and a decent amount of customization with the application.
Breakaway cable able to be switched with a normal headphone cable
Volume and mic mute adjustment easy to find and use
Mic quality is pretty good, all things considered.

Cons: Breakaway cable connecting the headset to inline USB chat dongle is prone to twisting, which for me resulted in eventually having to replace it due to damage caused by this phenomenon. This is fixed by unplugging it from either end and allowing it to unwind.
Maybe not quite as loud as I would like, but this could be preference.
Only minor adjustment to the fit with the strap provided.

Ultimately, I would recommend this headset if you're a fan of the Steelseries ecosystem. I would maybe opt for a wireless model, but this one isn't bad if that isn't your preference."
Sophie,4,Great Headset - Not As Good Mic for Feminine Voices,"Reviewed in the United States on March 18, 2022",Color: BlackStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,"This headset is pretty good. The dial is great, and after using a USB headset I don't think I can ever go back to using a jack headset. The RGB lights are fun and the customizability in the Steelseries program is pretty nice. I've only had two notable issues:

1) The left earpiece has a tendency to be quieter. Can't tell if this is a me issue with my own ear or a headset issue, but you can manually balance the speaker levels in your native sound systems so it's not that big of an issue.
2) The mic is great... For lower voices. I have a higher voice, and since this lacks some of the decibel levels in the high range, it's much more tinny for my voice. If you have a deeper voice this'll probably be better for you. Mic is still good quality, just sounds tinny.

Overall, I like it! Good and fun headset, get it on sale if you can."
Junk Logins,4,Fine headphones with one issue,"Reviewed in the United States on February 8, 2020",Color: BlackStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,"Headphones work fine, microphone is a little finicky to get situated to pick up voice without sound of breathing, but that might just be a personal issue as adjust a microphone leaves me winded.

Biggest problem (apparently pretty common with Arctis headphones) is that this headset includes a volume control knob designed to allow you to change the relative volume of 'chat' and 'game' channels. This is a neat feature in theory but suffers from a couple of issues:

A) The knob to adjust the volume is extremely easily turned, which means that if you don't put it somewhere nothing will touch it, you're likely to have one of the channels muted or rapidly changing volume before long
and
B) There's no version of the adapter to allow you to use the headphones with the microphone unless you have the knob attached, or a switch to lock/disable the knob. The output from the headphones is a special port that connects to the knob which outputs as a normal USB. You can also use a normal 3.5mm jack, but as the manufacturer notes, to do so is to lose out on the surround sound capability and other features.

All-in-all they're fine headphones, but if you're on the fence you should be aware that you will end up with an extra permanent feature on your desk that you have to keep isolated from any contact, which makes it a little hard to recommend them."

Mike S.,4,An excellent pair of headphones,"Reviewed in the United States on December 11, 2020",Color: BlackStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,"Pros:
* Good sound quality. I'm not sure what others are complaining about. They are much better than my HyperCloud headset, not quite as good as my Sennheiser HD 280 PRO but close (which of course dont have a mic, cost the same).
* Work great in Linux, which is somewhat of a miracle given the state of sound in Linux.
* Fancy RGB color shifting
* You can plug in a 3.5mm audio cable and it mixes it in with USB audio. This is nice for playing guitar for example, and not needing a separate mixer to mix the PC + guitar amp.
* Convenient controls, voice clear, overall very satisfied.

Cons:
* Proprietary cable
* Biggest complaint: I often find the USB cable gets unplugged. Perhaps this could be solved by a bigger USB cable between the proprietary dongle and headset (the one that ships is maybe 3.5 feet?). But if it pulls out at a critical moment (during a raid etc) it's a big problem.

Overall, I'm very satisfied and it's more than I expected given the cost."

My ears fit inside well.
The ear cups conform to your head a bit. Something I have found to be important especially for me since this allows it to fit better.

Cons
My head still seems to be a bit too big, and I have found that while the ear cups conform much better than others, the overall headset stretches a bit too much and causes a bit of pressure making it uncomfortable for extensive use.
For gaming though, I have used it for a few days now and just wearing it a couple hours a day seems fine!

I will continue to use this headset, and just carry on my search for a better fitting headset that my stupid head will be happy with!

I was dubious about the retractable microphone, but since this is a headset I bring back and forth to work, it is actually a really nice feature.

The volume adjust on the headset with the chat/game balance knob takes some getting used to, but is definitely not a bad feature. This headset is intended for people doing gaming rather than my primary purpose which is work, but it works very well in my role as a remote IT helpdesk manager/dispatcher.

SumTiemZ,4,Not SteelSeries quality headphones - Frost Blue was miles better.,"Reviewed in the United States on November 6, 2019",Color: BlackStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,"I bought a set of Siberia V2 Frost Blue SteelSeries headset circa 2014? The V2s I bought were used, on eBay, but lasted me up until this year. They never had any issues at all up until this year. That’s 5 YEARS of life out of a $60 pair of headphones. The sound quality was fantastic on those headphones. There was nearly no distortion and frequency response was incredible. I thought I may get another set of SteelSeries from the same quality, but these are lacking. Sound quality is no where near as good, doesn’t get as loud, and they feel somewhat cheap. Proprietary cables as well. They sound okay, but lack frequency response of the V2s and that’s a shame. I don’t expect these to last 5 years like my V2s, but I take care of my stuff. So here’s to hoping at least 3-4 years. This just feels like a cheap gamer aesthetic headset that focuses too much on RGB and looking fancy. The mic, however, blows the V2s out of the water - so that’s a big plus I guess. As far as comfy goes they also feel on par with my V2s. I’m just very disappointed in the sound quality and build. Otherwise I think if taken care of they will be okay."

Don’t let that take away from me saying that these SteelSeries still sound really good!

These are wired and the volume control on the cord is really sensitive. Sometimes I’ll try to move the cord and the knob just brushes against the floor a bit and changes the volume.

Mic: My friends say my voice sounds really clear and could hear a difference compared to my old mic that I was using. Mute button on the side is nice. Red light indicator on mic when mic is muted is also very nice

Overall good headset. I’m happy with it"
Rie,4,Great headset for regular use!,"Reviewed in the United States on October 14, 2022",Color: BlackStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,"Overall, I like this headset! I've been using earbuds for years and I thought I needed an upgrade. The audio is clear and the surround sound is on point making you feel like you're actually in the environment you're listening to. It fits my head comfortably and doesn't squish my glasses.

However, the RGB setting seem to not sync with the software on my end unless I have the prismsync app configuration on (although I am not a huge RGB fan so it doesn't bother me thst much)."
R. Killian,4,Works,"Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2022",Color: BlackStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,"I literally only bought these because I needed a mic because my antlion melted and I dont have room for a mic stand/arm. No immediate complaints. They sound fine, I rather like the game/chat dial, and the mic quality seems to be adequate/ I've asked people how it sounds compared to the old mic and it seems to be about on par.

Original pads not quite for me though, a little too little padding gives me pressure spots."
Shadowbuys,4,"It's a good headset for the price, I just have a few nit picks","Reviewed in the United States on May 28, 2021",Color: BlackStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,"This product is pretty good and seems to be worth it so far, there is a few small nit picks I have:
While the ski strap style band on it is pretty comfortable, it isn't very adjustable
the volume dial on the headset is very easy to accidentally bump
while the material that the muffs are made out of feel really good and don't make your ears sweaty, the actual cloth that they're made out of, while breathable, isn't the most comfortable to me personally.
Conclusion: While I'm no audiophile, this headset sounds good and the mic also sounds better than most I've had. It is a good step up from the the cheap ~$20-30 dollar rgb trash no name ""gaming headsets"" that are avalible on amazon while still not breaking the bank (to much) and it was worth the upgrade."

Sidenote feedback was awesome but people I was talking to (confirmed by mic settings) said i would fade in amd out if I was not talking directly into the mic, I think its due to the mic ANC"
martin rogers,4,"Only one complaint, location of the mixer on the cord.","Reviewed in the United States on December 13, 2022",Color: BlackStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,Good sound. Good comfort.

James Woods,4,Ringing in left ear when mic is being used.,"Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2019",Color: WhiteStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,"This headset is great. They are super comfortable, the audio quality is great, and the mic quality is as one would expect. The steelseries app, for RGB and other sound customization is very easy to use as well. The ""Chat/Game mixer"" Is my favorite thing about this headset by far. Easily letting you change chat/game volume to favor one or the other, without alt-tabbing or going into options.

**My only issue is that whenever an app is utilizing the mic (Discord, Skype, recording software, etc.) there is a very high pitched, noticeable ringing in the left ear. Seeing how this is the same side that the wire plugs into I am led to believe that this is just some sort of feedback issue. As of recently I have started recording/streaming, so this I am using the mic more often, therefore noticing this more often.

If you do not plan to stream alot, or use the mic an excessive amount then I would very much so recommend this headset. I personally am going to exchange mine for the wireless option to eliminate this issue."
Kevin Teeple,4,Better than the Arctis 3,"Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2019",Color: BlackStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,"For reasons beyond me, one day when I woke up, the back sound and microphone jacks on my computer stopped working. After simple troubleshooting showed me it wasn't a software issue, I was faced with possibly taking the computer to an expensive repair shop. But then I recalled that I read the SteelSeries Arctis 5 actually comes with a USB connection. I already had the SteelSeries Arctis 3. When the Arctis 5 arrived, I was pleasantly surprised. It works perfectly with my USB, it's comfortable, and the sound and microphone quality is good.
A few minor quibbles:
It comes with a separate knob supposedly to easily change the mix between in-game sound effects and the sound of fellow plays' audio, but the tiny pamphlet of instructions on it was unclear, so all I use it for is an indication of whether it's plugged in.
Also, it contains lights in the sides of the headphones, which is a really dumb place to have lights. It doesn't harm anything, but they serve absolutely no purpose whatsoever."

Hopefully fixed for new releases.","Reviewed in the United States on May 16, 2021",Color: BlackStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,"Been using this product for a year. Over all I say it was good. Most other head phones I bought always broke around the connectors but this head phone is made out of titanium so it's been extremely sturdy. Sound is good and mic is good.

The bads: The sound dongle thingy is super sensitive and always keep getting accidentally shifted. Never came to use and it was a source of frustration.

The driver for a few months kept turning on this setting called ""side tone"" after every restart. This setting is where you can hear your self through your microphone. The new driver did fix this issue but now the driver is incredibly intrusive with no way of turning off self update."
Raum,4,Gamer Specific features at a good price but with bad software.,"Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2020",Color: BlackStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,"The headphones look great, feel comfortable and provide good sound quality. it has a volume splitter knob that lets you balance different sound sources easily. This is amazing when you are playing a game and connected to discord talking to friends. One simple turn of a knob and you can turn chat up vs. game or vice versa.

The software is absolutely horrible. The 7.1 surround sound is filled with crackles and clipping even at low volumes making it unusable for anyone who cares about what they hear. That leaves the software to only control the lighting, which you can't even see because it is on the side of your head. Don't bother installing it unless you have a bunch of SteelSeries devices and want to control them all at once."
Stephanie D.,4,Great,"Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2022",Color: WhiteStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,"I bought this for work (gotta love those Zoom meetings). Audio is great, and definitely tunes out background noise on my end. I struggle with the mic because it loves to pick up every piece of noise, which then cuts the audio on my video call. I wish the mic/headset came with a small foam mic cover to try and filter the excess noise.

Aside from that, they are a very comfortable and versatile headset."

My only real complaint is that the cable hangs right over your shoulder.

Bought a new cable recently off the steelseries website but I am not having much luck with it still."

They finally got around to releasing a patch to unlock the rest of the locked out features. Given that, the product is now fully functional and as described at the point of sale. Rating is adjusted.
**************************************
To use these things to their full potential, you need to install SteelSeries Engine 3. That's no big deal, however to use the DTS functions you have to download additional software for the headset, and that process is currently broken. I emailed support, and their answer was ""we'll try to patch that in the future,"" marking my ticket solved without solving my problem. I paid for all of the features of these things, and they only delivered some of them. That's a solid bait and switch for nonfunctional equipment, and SteelSeries should be ashamed of their customer support team. One star."

This fit all the bills for the price point. For the record, you're not going to be getting premier sound quality out of these, but it is very good nonetheless.

David B.,4,"Great wired headphones, worth the money","Reviewed in the United States on January 22, 2020",Color: WhiteStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,"Switched from Sennheiser HD 202 headphones to these. Sound quality isn't as good, but is very close. These sound a little bit more hollow, but may be because my old headphones fit tighter over the ears. Steelseries software that comes with the headphones fixes everything though.

Mic is really good. My teammates can hear everything clearly and it does a good job of not picking up clicks and pops.

Fit is finicky. Took some adjusting of the ski strap to make it fit well. I also had to get used to the fit because they hurt my ears, got over it in less than a week.

Chatmix cable works really well for what it's meant to. But I don't find myself using it very much. As far as I know, it only works with Discord, so in game chat is read as game audio."
Oscar Martinez,4,Overall a good headset. One downside,"Reviewed in the United States on June 21, 2019",Color: BlackStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,"The only thing I have to say about this headset is that it's already breaking which is a bummer, since I personally think steel series makes the best headsets.

First, noise cancellation is perfect, customized it in the software and works perfectly fine.

Great for gaming, mic quality is amazing and is certified for discord!

The last thing, is for the worst. I've had this for about a month now and its fuzzing out now.

First the mic automatically turns off by itself sometimes, but not often.

Second, when I first boot up my pc, I have to mute, and unmute my mic so I can hear sound, which is annoying.

And lastly if you're an RGB fan, there's a chance that it will stop working.. (Like mine). BUT overall an amazing headset!"

dstamandone,4,"Great Headphones for gaming, decent for regular audio.","Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2019",Color: BlackStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,"I'm admittedly a bit of a snob when it comes to headphones; typically don't settle for anything that's less than stellar. I bought these to replace an aging pair of ""gaming"" headphones and they work quite well for that. Some of the features are a little confusing to use and the RGB LED requires software that I didn't want to have to load.

As for the audio quality it is very good. If you've got a high definition audio chipset or sound card then these headphones should sound fantastic with games. However, if you're used to pro-grade and studio stuff then you will likely notice that they have their limits here. These headphones aren't really for the studio though so audiophiles need not apply.

Overall, really solid gaming headset but I'd look for something with beryllium if you want top quality playback."

My bf has astro A20s and those are a lot tighter on the head in comparison. I got this for my Xbox series but keep in mind the led lights won’t work unless using with a PC. Since Xbox users can’t use the mixer it comes with just set up headset via jack as normal and then go to settings > devices and connections > accessories > connected headset.

Daniel M,4,Fantastic Headphones with one small issue.,"Reviewed in the United States on September 17, 2021",Color: BlackStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,I've used these for a few weeks now and they're fantastic headphones. The only issue I have is the connection on the actual headphones for the detachable cord is sometimes tricky to plug into. Since the plug in is inset into a small recess it can take some effort (Especially if you have large fingers) to plug it in. Otherwise these headphones have great sound and the mic quality is also fantastic.

My only complaint is that the wires are proprietary, and not always available. I had the USB jack get broken by a cat, and the only place to buy the USB to the nob portion of the headset was from teh Steelseries website. It was out of stock for quite some time and I was left twiddling until they got it back in, which took a bit."

Felt like I was in the same room as Lara Croft (wow!) Music also sounded great on these, and the microphone quality was excellent. The only downside to these wonderful headphones was that they did not fit my head. They fell off anytime I looked down or leaned back. The clamping force is so loose that they barely covered my ears, and adjusting the tightness of the strap on top was highly confusing. If you've got a larger sized head, then I would definitely recommend these headphones. The sound was clear, the mic was beautiful, and the design is suuuuper slick. If your head is on the smaller size, however, the headphones simply do not fit."

I wouldn't trade mine for these but for lightweight and forgetting you're wearing them the artis 5 are far superior. Everything but lightweight and comfort is beaten by the g pro x IMO.

Johnathan,4,Great Economic Headset,"Reviewed in the United States on December 26, 2018",Color: BlackStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,"I've had these for a bit now and I have to say that they are pretty wonderful. The look is aesthetically pleasing and the color changing light ring on the sided make it that much better. The design of the headset and cables allows a lot of breathing room when it comes to a setup. The only complaint I have is; the sound (although smooth, crisp, and clean) has suffered in the treble dept. The mic picks up your voice very well and music, games, and video sound exquisite, but there is no kick. Bass makes big moments feel intense, and unfortunately these just don't have any to give. So all in all great product, but you get what you pay for."
Brandon w,4,Updated review. They're average in sound quality but last forever,"Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2021",Color: BlackStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,"Good mid tier headphones. Gaming headphones so a bit more bass than I like. They're very difficult to pinpoint where gunfire is coming from aside from front, left, right, rear. They could double as good travel headphones. But you need something to push enough power to untilize it's speakers fully. Most phones can't do this, you need a dedicated mp3 player with amps.

I was a big fan of the hyper X cloud II and I would say this is pretty much the same headset in most aspects but the air flow is better. The quality feels kind of cheap like a $20 headset but you can’t have it perfect. If this had a solid premium feeling construction it would be perfect! Definitely buy it.

It barely reaches my mouth. Of course this will be different for each person, but I feel like they could've made it 1/2"" longer.

K&E,3,"Item was defective, but SteelSeries support was awesome.","Reviewed in the United States on March 5, 2024",Color: BlackStyle: Nova 3Verified Purchase,0,"This was my first SteelSeries headset coming from a broken down 6+ year old HyperX Cloud I think it was.

Overall, I liked the Nova 3. Loved the removable headband that can be replaced if needed. Loved the rgb lighting and especially the red light on the mic when muted. Loved the retractable mic. The SteelSeries GG companion app is quite robust, but good luck sorting through all the options. The sound overall was acceptable (couldn’t get sonar to work properly), but I had repeated issues with the sound quality of others voices specifically on Xbox. Fortunately Amazon was still able to do a return after return window closed because I had issues almost since day one, but kept it because I thought it was user error and kept tweaking things. Ended up returning.

Said all that to say this- I’ve seen in some others comments and reviews online about how crappy SteelSeries support is. That was most definitely NOT the case for me. I contacted them first during my troubleshooting and they responded within a day and had many suggestions to try and fix the problem. So morale of that story is, don’t believe everything you read in peoples negative reviews/comments. Even though I ended up returning the first, I was so pleased with SteelSeries support that I still went with SteelSeries for the replacement headset. Splurged for the Nova Pros for Xbox and couldn’t be happier with them. While much more expensive than the Nova 3s, the Pros sound infinitely better, chat and all."
Joe Winslow,3,One major annoyance for gamers,"Reviewed in the United States on March 26, 2024",Color: BlackStyle: Nova 3Verified Purchase,0,"A 4 star is probably more appropriate but I want to draw attention to this as it’s an issue every time you’ll game with these. The volume adjustment is on the left headphone, and regardless if you use a controller or keyboard your left hand is needed to hold forward so you don’t completely stop moving to adjust the volume. It wasn’t something I considered on my old headphones on the right but it is a regular inconvenience when it’s on the left side as you’ll lose the ability to adjust mid-game without stopping your movement completely."
Eric B.,3,"Too small and too ""distant"" to be a contender","Reviewed in the United States on October 24, 2023",Color: BlackStyle: Nova 3Verified Purchase,0,"Trying to replace headphones with new models is so difficult these days. Too small, not comfortable with glasses, poor sound quality through headphones compared to older models (44,800hz vs 96,000hz or higher). If you adjust the EQ levels it may help games, but music sounds like trash and vice versa.

These are much smaller earpieces than most other ""canceling"" headphones for this category. They fit small, feel like they're stretched when resting on my head and I wear a small hat. Weird. These feel like $25 Sony headphones from the 90s to me.

Sound is distant / the space between your ear and the speaker feels farther than it really is. Spatial sound, Dolby Atmos, and HRTF is abyssmal and not helpful with this headset.

Upon plugging in I heard 1:1 reproduction of every single sound in my room. Even a plastic wrapper crinkling across the room, I heard it back through my earpieces louder than it was originally. Installing Steelseries GG / Engine and disabling sidetone volume helped alleviate this. Do people actually like that?

Will be returning these to get a third set of Alienwares. Despite their pitfalls they are still the best fitting and most comfortable."

I have somewhere around average sized ears and these feel uncomfortable, along with my ears making contact with the speaker that is within' the headset. Also due to the small ass size of the headset the audio sounds semi-muffled and my previous headset that I broke (Razer Nari) which is priced at the same price as these headphones, sound better and feel much much better, only downside is those are a bit heavier. The Arctis Novas feel like a Chinese Knock-off of a steelseries product and because of how muffled everything is, sounds like it to.

King,3,Doesn't fit comfortable around my ears.,"Reviewed in the United States on October 22, 2023",Color: BlackStyle: Nova 3Verified Purchase,0,The headset doesn't fit comfortably around my ears. It might be because of the size of my ears but I sort of got to fit my ears inside and they will hurt after wearing the headset for too long. Also I don't know if the noise cancelling is only for the mic which might have been a misunderstanding on my side because I was hoping they can block out the sound that goes on around my apartment which it doesn't help with. The sound at least seems good enough.
Robert Rose,3,"Sounds okay, feels okay, software irritated me enough to drop a star.","Reviewed in the United States on October 26, 2021",Color: BlackStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,"I've had this headset for about 8 months. It sounds okay. I'm not an audiophile. I've noticed the latency seems to feel a little worse than the 3.5 hyperx I had before, but also seems to improve a little with some windows tweaks by explicitly disabling enhancements (could be placebo), but I'm not that surprised since it's connected via usb and shows up as two audio devices to the OS.

I have their audio software installed. I generally forget it exists.

Something that did annoy me just now, however, and inspired me to write this, is that my audio completely died in the middle of playing a certain shall-not-be-named moba. It died, came back, and died again, lagged my computer, and finally pulled me out of fullscreen to show me a stupid ""steelseries gg"" window. Really cool of you to decide you waited too long for me to click update and to just force it on me while I'm actively using the computer.

Interrupting what I'm doing to force an update on me is something Windows already does plenty and I don't need your junkware to do it to me too, considering the software doesn't really do anything meaningful for me anyway.

Mind, that doesn't happen often and it only actually happened this particular time. And granted, I'd been ignoring the constant notifications of it begging me to update it. Despite that, I find it ridiculous enough that they would force an update on you while you're doing something in a way that interrupts what you're doing for a good 30 seconds."

Mighty D.,3,Good/Bad,"Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2023",Color: BlackStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,1,"The build of the attics 5 look nice but compared to other headphones for the same price it has too much plastic components and makes it feel like a $60 headset. Software is good and very customizable. The ear cushions good for comfort and sound but other noises will leak through the cushions which makes it bad for people who like feel of immersion in a game/movie/music. The audio Jack adaptor is bad, it’ll make a static noise when moving around or accidentally bumping it, wouldn’t recommend using it unless you have too. The sound quality without dts is okay. The sound quality with DTS on is good but not great, depending on what you play. Some sounds will be distorted such as explosions, humming, and buzzes, making the quality of the headset feel cheap.

Sam,3,Decent headphones but I'd avoid shooters,"Reviewed in the United States on June 15, 2020",Color: BlackStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,"Honestly, I wanted to like the headphones and they are by no means horrible. They just didn't live up to the sound quality of my old razer kracken headsets when it came to shooter games like valorant. The ""7.1 surround"" for gaming felt a bit off as if I could hear footsteps from far away but not hear them right in front of or next to me. The headset in game also wasn't very loud even with both windows and game audio set to the max.
I tried my best to boost audio quality with the steel series engine 3 software, but it just didn't have the same level of customizability as razer synapse.
The mic quality was also pretty bad, in order to put up with the summer heat I have two fans in my room meaning I need noise cancelation to work properly so I don't annoy my gaming buddies and it does work, but it also makes you almost impossible to hear unless the mic is literally touching the corner of my mouth, my friends also joked that the new headset took the bass out of my voice and that hit to my pride was the last straw lol.

All in all, these are a good headset for their price and if you are making an upgrade from a cheaper/worse headset you'll love them, but if you already had an expensive headset and needed a replacement these might be a downgrade. I've just decided to return these and purchase another Razer kracken 7.1 V2 and hope I treat them better this time."

But this review is about this steel series one. I was REALLY excited about it, and I had high expectations for it. It's not uncomfortable, but not anything special. it LOOKS really nice, but the mic is awful. I put the noise cancellation on high and there was still so much noise from my keyboard to being able to hear me breath. its really annoying because when its not in the right spot it wont pick up my voice. the mic is just really annoying and I never had any of these issues on my corsair headset. Also theres this knob on the wire that connects it to your computer that allows you to change the ratio of game-to-chat volume which i thought was really cool at first UNTIL i found out that its super sensitive and will randomly mute your chat/game if you move or something. Idk, its not BAD, it's decent, just for 100 bucks i feel like you're paying more for the looks than the quality of sound/mic, and I'm personally going to return it and just purchase a new version of my old headset, save me 20 bucks and go back to something i know will at least last me for a couple years."

I wish I had this heads up before buying them, but the price isn't too bad (around $40 when I bought them?) so I'm not that mad. anyway, I hope this warns any future rhythm game players.

extra info:
- I tried turning off surround sound, but that did little to help the situation. plus, the hitsounds still end up sounding delayed. really sad about this because they're really pretty headphones :("
Nikelz,3,Comfortable but thoughtless design and awful sound quality,"Reviewed in the United States on January 9, 2021",Color: WhiteStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,It's a shame because I thought the Arctis 5 was very comfortable. I have jaw issues and am sensitive on the top of my head so finding a non hugging and heavy resting headset has been rough. This headset is lightweight and the band allows for no plastic touching my head. I would have kept this is the audio wasn't complete garbage. Both the sound and the mic are just inferior compared to other headsets. I was going to replace a pair of Astro A40s which were nowhere near perefct.. I have had to replace cables a half dozen times and the padding snapped right off the top.. but the audio and voice quality is just so much better than the Arctis that I can't do it.. I'm not even an audiophile. The Arctis just sounds so tinny with no depth and everyone said that I sound awful on voice chat. Not to mention that you have to have the mic literally like in your mouth because the noise cancellation is ridiculous and there's a bright obnoxious red light that shines in your eyes when you have it muted.. literally seeing red with this heartbreaking headset!
SN,3,Cable Damages With Normal Use...,"Reviewed in the United States on December 31, 2019",Color: BlackStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,"Having previously bought a SteelSeries gaming headset a few years back that I loved, I decided to give this headset a try to replace the prior unit (which experienced heavy use, but kept on trucking without an issue). After less than a year of light to normal use, I've got to say I'm a bit disappointed.

The actual headset is solid, and the LED color options are quite fun. However, the key weakness of the unit is its cabling. There are two parts, a cable with a USB connection and one with a 3.5mm connection, and they join together with an adapter piece that has a knob that can control source audio (either game audio or speech audio).

In a case of ""great in theory, bad in practice"", the connectors don't always join together properly, and it can lead to crackly audio at times. Worse, the actual wire within the cabling seems to be damaged, when I move it around a bit, the audio will also crackle. Sometimes, my outbound audio will even drop out entirely, while I can still hear audio coming into the headphones.

Overall, good product in theory, but poor execution. Reaching out to SteelSeries now to see what they can do about it, here's hoping!"

The audio quality is no where near what I expected after having 2 other 7.1 headsets I had to return for software/mic issues and hearing DTS was similar to 7.1, maybe I just don't like DTS sound but it also only seemed to have 360 degree sound some of the time and the audio. The inline knob is not an adjustment for the volume it's a chat mix dial which doesn't make any sense. It means that the headset shows up in windows as two different headsets so you can make one the voip output and the other the game output and adjust the two.... sound like a good idea, but only if you have never tested it for more that a few minutes. Over the course of the night I had to RE-adjust the audio 20 times or more because it kept getting moved or touched slightly causing it to kill the game or chat volume or ruin the mix, It is a terrible idea and clearly didn't get tested which makes sense why no one else has this feature"

When pulling out the contents of the box it felt a little difficult to pull out, as if the box was stuffed back in incorrectly, but all the wires and the headset seemed like they were set in place as they should have been. The plastic covering the headset to prevent scratches was still on the headset, but they weren't stuck on all the way. The wires were also in a their bag part way. Not sure if these are concerns for quality control, or if someone had opened the box and tried their best to put the contents back in as they had seen before.

Aside from the box being unsealed, the headset seems to work just fine. Audio quality is decent, comfort is really nice compared to my last headset (Logitech G430), and mic quality seems to be good, if not better.

For my surprise, the sound is not that good. I have to turn it all the way up in the first place to have a lot of sound, while my LOGITECH gives me the same volume setup on 55 out of 100. The sound from the Steelseries Arctis 5 in the foreground faded as the sound in the background stays loud. I tried different setups via software and still it was the same.
The sound of my guns in my Fallout 4 game, using the LOGITECH are as real and they get, with a lot of echo and bass when have to, but on this Steelseries Arctis 5, the sound of my weapons is minimized and dully, not punchy as they should and not clear and better than the sound that I get from my LOGITECH.

OpinionatedDoofus,3,Comfortable but Functionally Clunky,"Reviewed in the United States on April 27, 2019",Color: WhiteStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,"Based on the performance of this headset at it's price range, I think I'd give it a good 4.5 or even 5 out of 5 stars. The sound is clean, a bit on the quiet side and the microphone picks up quite well. My main issue with the headset is that the chord comes in two pieces, with a ChatMix knob in the middle. For those of us with gaming chairs on wheels, this is basically a death trap for disconnecting your voice chat in the middle of a game.

There's hardly any resistance on the ChatMix dial so I've had multiple games now where slight movements which cause something to bump into the dial will turn off my team's voice via the ChatMix knob and when I reach down to fix it, the connecting piece will sometimes disconnect because the connection isn't very secure.

Since there are a lot of issues with using this for gaming, I'll be bringing these to work to use as an office headset that can toggle easily between teleconferencing and music. It's a bit expensive for that function but they look good and sound nice."

The RGB lighting is ok for the ear pieces but the lights for the mute button and microphone don’t work.

However, the effort in trying to get the mic to ""properly"" pick up your voice is just insane. I am the ""raid mother"" for my group of pals where I do mechanic call outs and such and I received so many complaints because people just could not hear me with the mic on this headset. No amount of tweaking settings in Windows, Discord, or the headset app could help. The guide they have to face the mic a certain way looks simple enough, but it just doesn't help. At first, I thought it was because I'm a generally soft speaker however, I learned that another friend has this headset except he has the Arctis 7 which uses the same mic and I can almost NEVER hear him. He still loves the headset enough to keep it, although our group of friends can't hear him. I ended up returning these and downgrading to an Astro A10.

Tim Trischuk,3,Nice headphones but software has issues,"Reviewed in the United States on December 22, 2018",Color: BlackStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,"The hardware is well designed for gaming but there are continually issues with the steel series software. After finally resolving my problems, the next windows update broke it again. A subsequent update front Arctis did fix the issue but I don't think a headset should be so complicated in terms of the drivers. It loses two stars for buggy software because the headset stops functioning. Uninstalling the software actually fixes some issues, so there ought to be better fallback modes! The microphone should not just stop working!
So while overall these are good headphones and good hardware, the software, although slick and apparently polished, is just too fragile and messes up often. If I get better operation without the drivers at any point, there's a serious lack of quality control here. Slick is good but basic function has to take first priority"
Carlos DelCastillo,3,Awful default sound settings,"Reviewed in the United States on February 12, 2019",Color: BlackStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,"I bought these headphones as an upgrade from my previous 50 dollar pair. Out of the box the headphones are extremely poor sound quality. The surround sound makes it sound like youre playing inside an empty hallway. After you turn off 7.1 dolby it still sounds bad and I had to download a third-party EQ software to adjust it. Luckily, some people on reddit had the same problem with these and after changing the settings around in the EQ software they sound great. They are nice headphones, they are very comfortable. My friends say my mic sounds a lot better and the lighting is very nice. I wish for the price they would require less set up.

PROS:
Very comfortable, can easily wear for long sessions.
Mic is very good for a gaming headset.

CONS:

Kaylee,3,Don't like that chat,"Reviewed in the United States on July 14, 2022",Color: BlackStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,While the headphones are comfy and the quality of sound and mic are great I can't rate it 5 stars because of the chat nob.

Wassn,3,Bad quality headset,"Reviewed in the United States on April 12, 2022",Color: WhiteStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,The built quality of this headset feels cheap. Didn't last even a year yet and it's already making static noises here and there. Also the hearing direction from the back space gave out on me already. Look somewhere else if you're shopping for a better high quality headset with longer lifespan.
Derek,3,"Worked well for 2 years, now is having issues","Reviewed in the United States on September 10, 2020",Color: WhiteStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,"Pros : Good sound , Loud, Lasted 2 years without any problems
Cons : only lasted 2 years without any problems.

Problem now is with the inbuilt ""GAME"" channel. Which has been my default channel on my PC for two years and I've had a Digital Audio input ""listened"" too on the game channel this whole time. As of 3 days ago. the game channel doesn't work for any app until i twist the physical chat/game balance dial and the software channels can interact with it anymore. I've switched my Digital in over to the chat channel but not i cant balance discord with my ps4 anymore. :/"
L3NU2,3,"Its ""Meh""","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2020",Color: BlackStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,"It sounds fine. I have a small head, so the bottoms of the earcups don't actually touch my head not allowing for a complete seal. The stock ear cups are terrible. You'll start to feel itchy after a few hours of playing. So I upgraded to BRAINWAVEZ earcups. The headset is also very loose on the head, which has it's pros and cons. When I look down it starts to slide. Overall, its an okay headset, but I would really recommend spending the extra 20 dollars on the Steelseries Arctis 7."
Kaveh A,3,"Decent Sound, Terrible Fit","Reviewed in the United States on January 29, 2021",Color: BlackStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,"I'm not sure what demographic these headphones are tailored for, but for an adult head, these puppies will hurt your ears. As of this writing, both my ears' outer areas feel like I've been sleeping on cinder block pillows for the last week. The padding around the hard plastic ear pieces just isn't enough, leaving your ears in pain from having the headphones pushed against your head.

Love the subtle LED lights and appreciate the sound quality, but I can't handle the ergonomics."

It is comfortable though. The rgb is nice and it is cool that you can customize it on pc. I currently use a broken PS4 Gold Wireless headset (I raged and threw it to the grown, smashing it into a few pieces, but I put it back together). It looks ugly, the audio buffers and gives out a white noise, but it is still better than the Steel Series Arctis 5. I would personally price it at like $60-$80."

The band isnt a really effective way to keep the headphones on you head without moving. Sound quality is good, no cons regarding that. It comes with a small attachment to convert the wire to AUX, so you can connect it to your phone. The attachment breaks from the wire with very little pulling pressure and the wire is super long for a phone (why not shorten it and make the computer usb wire the only long one?"

The microphone seemingly stopped working all of a sudden. Literally worked fine one night. The next day they didn't. I uninstalled all drivers, made sure all connections were tight, all the usual troubleshooting. No dice. They look brand new and have been taken care of. I reached out to Steelseries and was advised they would not do anything as I was a couple months past the warranty period. I would expect them to last well over a year if taken care of."
TGilbertie,3,"Great headset for PC, terrible headset for Xbox","Reviewed in the United States on May 11, 2020",Color: BlackStyle: Arctis 5,0,"I've had this headset for around 2 years now, and this is what I have to say about it. In regards to how it does on the PC, it does great! The sound quality is really good, especially for gaming, the RGB lights are extremely customizable, the game/chat mixer is really solid and handy (however over time, bit and crumbs can get in there and make the slider less smooth, but it's not too noticeable) and it is overall a great headset for PC. In regard to how it does on Xbox, well, that's an entirely different story. The RGB does not work on Xbox due to the adapter, which is fine by me because it's not the end of the world for me, but the adapter for the Xbox is what honestly ruins this whole experience. For the first one, maybe two weeks, the adapter works just fine, but after that, good luck. After that, the adapter stops working more and more and requires you to do weird things just to get it to function optimally. The main bizarre thing I had to do was sort of wiggle with the connector in the controller until it works, and even then, after a while, it stops working period. So I thought to myself, okay, it might be the case that this is a faulty, defective adapter. So I went on the SteelSeries website and ordered an accessories pack that had the adapter in it around 6 months. When it came, I replaced the old one, and the exact same thing happened. And this is all a shame because I like this headset, but if you can't even do the adapter right, why make it compatible with Xbox at all. This gets 2 stars from me."
claire,3,not the best,"Reviewed in the United States on May 22, 2019",Color: WhiteStyle: Arctis 5,0,"I bought this headset roughly a year ago. I used to have a cheap turtle beach one that was complete trash and I needed a change. Since Faze was constantly advertising this brand I thought I would give it a try. When it arrived, I was pretty disappointed that when plugged into an xbox controller the side lights wouldn’t work, but I got over it. It was also so annoying when the volume would just turn up and down on its own. My biggest problem with this headset is THE ECHO. I can’t explain to you how horrible the echo would be while I was in xbox parties. It literally never ended. Therefore, I’m about to switch over to logitech or hyperX for my next headset. IF YOU PLAY CONSOLE DON’T WASTE YOUR MONEY."

I have $5 earbuds from the dollar store that lasted longer than these. Luckily the warranty lasts for a year and I can get a replacement, but still."
Chris T.,2,Poor Microphone and Subpar Sound Quality,"Reviewed in the United States on October 9, 2023",Color: BlackStyle: Nova 3Verified Purchase,0,"I was in dire need of new headphones, so I bought these in a pinch hoping they'd be an upgrade from my previous pair (Logitech G432) Despite being double the price of my previous headset, these were significantly worse in most ways.

The sound was mediocre at best, only slightly remedied by some EQ adjusting. Not terrible sound, but I felt it really lacked weight, and everything sounded tinny, even after EQ.

The microphone itself was pretty bad with a constant static buzzing sound. The only fix for this was to use Steelseries' GG software, which does help by giving you access to AI noise cancelling. That made the mic sound fine, but I think that it's still unacceptable to require AI noise cancelling for adequate quality.

I'm not sure if my model was defective, but I also noticed a constant hum when there was no audio playing. I later discovered that this was caused by the lights on the headset, as turning them off fixed it. Not a problem for me, but I think that's a big issue when the lights are one of the few gimmicks for your product.

One good thing is that the cable is detachable; however, the cable was really 'rigid' The cable was firm and brushed against my shoulder often, and to make it worse, you can hear it every time it rubs on something, so I had to snake it around my lap (which was incredibly inconvenient).

Lastly, the software for these feels very invasive and unintuitive. Seemed heavy on resources compared to competing software, too.

I had a better experience with headphones half the price, so I was very disappointed with these. For the same price, I got Razer's Blackshark V2's, and I think that they improve on nearly every aspect of these for the same exact price."

The hardware quality on this mic seems to be ok but the software makes me want to cry. I've updated firmware, my PC is up to date, I've tried reinstalling drivers. It just keeps breaking, sound randomly stops working or suddenly there will be crazy screeching through your mic if you're recording (but you won't hear it in your headset until after you're done recording). So many bugs, it's driving me crazy. If you need a setup that is more than a house of cards, do not go this route."

Emily Taylor,2,Firmware Updates Kill This Product,"Reviewed in the United States on March 31, 2023",Color: BlackStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,"I really wanted to like this headset. Sound was great, mic was great, but the constant firmware updates that SteelSeries puts out makes this headset impossible to use. If it needs an update, which seemed to happen every day to every other day, it would have connectivity problems and mic problems. So, the logical thing to do would be to go through with the update, right? Well, I would do that, but it was never an easy process. The update would either freeze halfway through, forcing me to close the program or unplug the headset (which the program warns against because it could fry the headset, but if it's frozen, there's nothing else you can do), or an alert would pop up telling me that there was a problem with the update and to try again. The latter would happen multiple times before it would finally work. On the off chance it WOULD work on the first try, it only seemed to happen when there was still an update to do afterwards, which would then go through these same problems.
I returned my original headset and got a new one, hoping it was just a weird headset that I got, but no, the problem lies with the company's updates that they constantly put out.
The only thing that kept me from giving this product one star is the fact that when it did work, it was a good product."
Justin Turczak,2,Constant Static,"Reviewed in the United States on January 14, 2024",Color: BlackStyle: Nova 3Verified Purchase,0,"Seeing as these are a headset, sound quality should be the most important aspect.

Destinys Chyld,2,I want so much to love this headset...,"Reviewed in the United States on January 11, 2019",Color: WhiteStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,"I was excited to get another headset from Steel Series, My old one I have had forever and I loved it so much... I had the SteelSeries Siberia v2 and broke my heart when it started to act up and not work anymore. To be fair though I had that headset for almost 3 years and I took very good care of it.

This one? Well I was super happy to find a headset that had the air weave cushions for the ears... Leather is SOO SOO hot... these are super comfortable, and I love wearing them... but theres a catch... The strap on the top to ""adjust"" it so it fits everyone? well it doesnt... The headset constantly slips off my head since its too large for me, the velcro isnt really adjustable. If I tip my head back even an inch it just falls off. Ive tried to adjust it and it just cant be fixed..

Now for the mic, it is not clear my old one was super clear and I sounded like myself. Now? This is not clear at all, its tinny and I sound distorted.. I am so very disappointed but I have no choice but to stick with them since I cant get my hands on another set of Siberia for cheap ( ish )

Next thing I absolutely HATE about this headset, its the wire... Its split into three parts, two if you are using it with PC like I am. You have a wire that goes from the headset to the middle of the full length of the wire.. You connect it there to a button that is so sensitive that if you bump it even a little, it messes with the sounds. Lowering the sounds of some things and making other things louder. I get thats its function, but its soo so so so sensitive. That is my third point of what I hate about this headset... The button in the middle of the wire. Its fine that its there, but why is it so easy to move? Just bumping it with my elbow? or it brushing on my arm? come on...

I wouldnt recommend these to anyone. I would shop around... This is a bad headest imo... and rather expensive ( which I dont mind because I pay for quality I would be fine with the price if the product wasnt so badly designed."

The SkiBand is amazing on the head, and you will not feel anything even after 5 hours of sitting with them on. The ear cups are soft and durable, as they didn't flake even after the headphones themselves started to break.

I think the only downside I could find for the headphones, is if paused during certain frequencies in video's or songs, the headphones would produce a very audible electric zap. I'm not sure how to describe it, but that's the best I could come up with. It wasn't a major issue for me, as it happened maybe once every 10 pauses, but I think it's worth mentioning.

Upon receiving the money from the warranty company, Asurion, I decided to repurchase the Arctis 5, and noticed that there are 2 versions of this, the 2019 and the modern. I went with the modern, as I thought they could have improved on the one problem it had, but I was dead wrong.

The modern Arctis 5 headphones felt clunky and cheap, while the 2019 felt sturdy and powerful. The sound problem it had on pausing was even more persistent, and the ear cups were extremely bad, to the point my ears hurt after wearing them for 30 minutes. My ears aren't big by any means, but the ear cups just got so compressed, as they had no push to them, that my ears touched the plastic no matter how I positioned the headphones.

Overall, if you're looking at new headphones, and considering between the Arctis 5 and something else, get the 2019 Model over the modern one."

I could never get the sound above a whisper on this headset. I even contacted Steelseries customer service for assistance, they were unable to assist. Not saying this product is junk, it’s just not compatible with the XBOX series X is all. I ordered the XBOX brand wireless set up. Works amazingly well. Please change the description on this product so it states “Not ideal for Xbox users!” Thank you."
Williams Israel Martinez Tejada,2,"Good quality, but...","Reviewed in the United States on March 17, 2021",Color: BlackStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,"I don't like leather because my hear hurts after 30 minutes, so I decided to buy this one, after having this for about 1 year and a half, I decided to post a review. These are perfect for everything but gaming (sounds ironic, but it's the truth).

Pros:
- Not heavy, so you can use it for tons of hours and it won't hurt.
- Good mic quality.
- You can hide the mic.
- Game and Chat mode, the headphone includes an small controller which allows you to receive inputs from the game and from any other stuff at the same time (i.e Discord). So if your teammates in discord are talking a lot, you can decrease Chat's volume and increase Game volume, which helps a lot.

Cons:
- The volume needs to be really high for you to hear steps and specific sounds, which will make you go crazy, because shots are really loud.
- Everyone that gets close to you can hear what you're listening to (If you re listening music).
- The pads start smelling a little bit bad after 5-6 months.
- Steel series software is terrible, they don't have presets for specific games or specific game categories (FPS, Sports, etc)... Which they should, because everyone buys this headphones to play, not for a music recording professional studio.

If I knew all these things before purchasing this headphones, I probably would've bought a Logitech G Pro headphones, Sennheiser Game ONE or HyperX Cloud, this headphones are not it."
Ebraheem Karaein,2,Audio quality,"Reviewed in the United States on October 12, 2023",Color: BlackStyle: Nova 3Verified Purchase,0,The headset overall is alright. The mic is nice and the headset fits comfortably. The audio on the other hand is pretty terrible compared to other headsets at the same price. The sonar and SteelSeries engine is extremely annoying and difficult to deal with and makes buying the headset a complete waste.

Unfortunately the audio drivers inside are really not up to the task. The audio cuts out at lower volumes, and there are random bursts of loud static over USB-C with the provided cable as well as good quality 3rd party braided cables. Very disappointing."

Mary,2,The cord is obnoxiously long. NOT buying again or recommending ever.,"Reviewed in the United States on April 11, 2022",Color: BlackStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,"The cord isn't adjustable. There is often a ton of the cord piled on the floor and the volume randomly going silent. The silence is always caused by a knob that is located somewhere along the half point on this cord. My feet might accidentally kick the pile or I'll get up and the knob with lower the volume. I've been dealing which is annoyance but I think I've really had it when the cord got tangled up in my computer chair wheels and shredded the exterior of the cord.. The length and the volume knob (that I NEVER use), are just not functional for my basic needs.

Other than that, I relatively like this head set when it comes to sound and comfort. I even really like that there are buttons to mute your mic and change the volume on the side of your head set. This wire/cord issue is just too much. I won't be buying again or recommending."
Hector Sanchez Jr,2,Don't buy it,"Reviewed in the United States on October 15, 2022",Color: BlackStyle: Nova 3Verified Purchase,0,"The headset itself looks nice but it does not function very well. Every time I turn on my laptop, I have to change my settings to even use the microphone. I was in a discord call and no one could hear me until I went and disabled the headset app. When I was in said discord call, I ""muted"" myself using the mute button on the side of the headset but everyone can still hear me anyway. That was the breaking point for me so I came on here to try to return it but unfortunately I was over the month so I could not return it. So now I am here writing a review on it. Look for better and cheaper alternatives."

And in solo games, I do, for surround sound/ location of enemy identification, they are great. BUT IF YOU PLAY WITH OTHER PEOPLE, prepare yourself to get non stop complaints about voice echo and your mic picking up every. Single. Noise from your game. Not to mention the fact that there is a short in my mic, so sometimes your voice isn’t picked up at all. Annnnnd the mute button doesn’t work at all.. I have spent a lot of money on many many many.. many.. items on amazon for the last 5 ish years.... this is my first review. The echo is bad enough that I had to review them. I have Razor Pros as well, and in spite of that headset not having as good of surround sound and too sealed of an ear material (gets too hot.) I find myself wearing those during most Fortnite rounds because my friends complain about my echo and game sound pickup... with my sound system turned off.... if you’re a solo player. Exclusively, they’re awesome. If you ever play with other people, especially Fortnite.. they are hell for your teammates and you shouldn’t buy them. My big regret with these is that I kept hoping they would workout fine after some time with some sound balancing and now it’s too late to return them.... just don’t buy them..."
Aleksey,2,Self-Defeating,"Reviewed in the United States on December 14, 2019",Color: BlackStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,"This headset confuses me.

On the one hand-- I think that, under absolutely perfect circumstances, it can deliver pretty decent sound comparable to any similarly-priced pair of ""real"" headphones. The frequency response would be almost entirely neutral if not for a slight hump in the upper bass, which muddies things up a bit.

On the other hand-- under any ""real"" conditions, it'll fail to do this. It's incredible sensitive to positioning! Attempting to use this thing was like trying to wear headphones with thick-framed glasses (maybe working sunglasses . . .), but without the glasses. Tilt your head? Say goodbye to the sound of that ear. Sneeze? Enjoy listening without bass. Shift a bit in your seat? Everything gets muffled.

Put another way: if you've ever had a cheap, terrible ""TN"" or ""Twisted Nematic"" monitor that could only be used if you took care to look at it the right way, the Arctis is that experience translated to headphones. Seriously bizarre.

Also: Steelseries' implementation of a ""comfort strap"" (the elastic headband under the plastic headband) is terrible. I should've realized it from the pictures, but it doesn't adjust or conform to your head automatically in any way, like most real headphones with this feature.

I get it. It's a gaming headset. But it could've been good!"

Gaming was OK, but honestly my treblab Bluetooth sound better and they are 3 years old.

Matt Hill,2,I want to love these,"Reviewed in the United States on June 26, 2021",Color: BlackStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,I wanted to love these headphones...but I couldn't. They are beautiful headphones the rgb is nice the retractable mic is convenient and the audio chat nob is very cool. But the sound which is the most important things these are for was not good. I could hear a bullet casing hit the ground by my right foot with the highest quality sound with the 7.1 surround sound. But my footsteps and talking sounded like it was underwater. The headphones squeeze my head to hard and wearing glasses with them gave me an extreme headache. I want to love these but they are going back and I'm get corsairs

Tickets with SS are answered within a few days, but they are basic things like ""Did you reboot"" and not helpful at all. As an IT guy for over 30 years I find them very lacking for support. Once turned way up you can definitely hear a lot of in game sounds with the majority of regular sounds sounding a little muted."

That's where the good ends and the bad begins.

These headphones have mediocre sound quality, leak sound, and have minimal isolation. They don't function well as headphones nor as a microphone. There's also this annoying, clunky connector you have to use if you want to enable the microphone. Your headphones plug into the connector, which has a usb jack and a volume knob. This is one of the most irritating setups that has ever plagued my desk. These heaphones an attractive mediocre piece of equipment for $90.

The sound balance settings are fine on my computer and other headphones still work fine. I've searched it up and this appears to be a common issue with either the headphones themselves or the chatmix dial cable connection.

Another thing I dislike about this headset is the little volume/mic knob that sits on the wire. If you don't lay it down somewhere It easily turns the volume off by bumping it into something.

Zip Zap,2,Worst headset I've ever used,"Reviewed in the United States on April 23, 2022",Color: WhiteStyle: Arctis 5,0,"Every single day, I have to face one issue after another with these headphones. They thought it was a good idea to put the very loose knob that controls the mix of voice and game audio on the wiring, so sometimes the volume would change whenever I accidentally move the wiring on the floor.

And then not even a few months after using this, I got audio popping, which I temporarily solved by reinserting the USB. Then I was met with awful audio distortion with the pitch being raised or lowered with additional popping.

Now, I'm here, writing this review, as the headphones don't even work anymore. Met with audio cutting in and out, as I get ""set address failed"" and other errors when I try to plug it in.

I've only had this for 2 and a half years."

The addition of USB was nice but the addition of a mic/sound dial was stupid and I never found a use for it. The wires get really tangled and the selection of rubber causes them to become sticky over time. After 3 months of use, my headset stopped getting recognized by the Steelseries Engine and I reset my computer to no avail. I was disappointed but there was nothing I could do about it. Soon after, the really flimsy and stupid proprietary connectors bent off which broke my cable and the USB adapter because they use the crappiest copper shielding. I bought a new cable off eBay and decided to use the headphone adapter instead. The right speaker broke off after a year of use and the cushions feel awkward and uncomfortable in the ears. I have been stuck with these awkward pieces of crap for the past 1 1/2 and I am practically hearing mono sound only since my right speaker broke off.
Great headphones, but only for a short amount of time. If steelseries were to up the anti and fix the crappy and cheap material used to build their products, I would totally buy these again but for right now, I don’t recommend them."

Liam,1,Great when working... when working,"Reviewed in the United States on March 27, 2023",Color: BlackStyle: Nova 3Verified Purchase,0,"Context for the order:
My headphones ($40 Razer Kraken Green Wired) died and I needed a quick and cheap replacement (but also an upgrade).

From reviews and price, these were the pick for me but after using them for less than a month, these suck. First off these do not work out of the box (as far as I know on PC) they need a software update from the SteelSeries gg app which I would be fine doing if it were that easy but I plugged them in through aux and it would refuse to update at all (which I should have realized as its aux, duh) so I plugged it in through USB-C on my motherboard and that refused to work as well, it didn't even detect the headphones so I had to unplug stuff to make room for a USB-A port on my PC that I could use, and finally it worked and I could use these headphones. unfortunately, when I used them the next day I was randomly switched to a different audio interface on my computer, and after a while of trying to fix this I found out that the SteelSeries gg app has a ""sonar"" feature that works like a digital audio mixer and it would switch to a different audio device anytime I put my computer in sleep mode/power off/restart, so I googled if there was any way to stop that and I found the only way was to disable all my other audio devices (which is completely stupid), so had to turn that feature off and everything was good again until the next time I put my computer in sleep mode/power off/restart and the headphones would make an extremely loud noise anytime audio played. I fixed this by replugging the headphones back in and now have to do that EVERY TIME I USE THEM ON MY COMPUTER. I will say I was satisfied with the audio quality (although my previous headset sounded leagues better (to me at least)) and the mic was of equal quality to my previous one (at least according to my friends on discord). But, it is safe to say I was not satisfied with the headphones or the required software and will probably steer away from Steelseries next time I upgrade them, and I will probably get another razer kraken or something for $50 instead of these for $67. (side note: I also assumed they were Bluetooth because they had a removable wire, they are not, and that's completely my fault for assuming)

TL;DR
These don't work out of the box (on pc), the software required sucks, and they need to be replugged every time when leaving sleep mode. Just get a razer kraken for $50."
Margaret L. Johnson,1,Insanely loud bursts of sound after 1yr use,"Reviewed in the United States on December 12, 2023",Color: BlackStyle: Nova 3Verified Purchase,0,"I loved these headphones a lot. When they first came, the cable that came with it created some weird static noise whenever I plugged it in, but I was focused on being able to use them as soon as possible so I just bought another cable and used that. Everything has been fine up until about two months ago. My headphones have begun emitting an incredibly loud, eardrum-breaking sound as soon as my PC boots up (and sometimes as I game). It doesn't happen all the time, so when it does unexpectedly happen, I get an earful of painfully loud noise. There's also that same weird static noise that I got when I first bought them, and it's happening much more frequently now. I'm going to be buying yet another cable to see if that solves the issue, but man this is ridiculous. The lights on the side sometimes stop working, too, so I unplug and plug them back in again and they begin showing once again. I bought coverage with it, and they're unable to send me an actual replacement and only offer a gift card, which I don't want to do because the price has gone up since I bought it last year. Truly disappointing, they could be fantastic if I didn't have to fix all of the other problems it has constantly."
Jared M. Stander,1,"Terrible Mic, Meh Everything Else","Reviewed in the United States on June 28, 2019",Color: WhiteStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,"I hate this headset. Based on the reviews it sounded pretty nice, and the headset DOES work via USB on PS4, which is what I use it on along with my PC.

But the cable is obnoxiously long. It's two parts, the cable from the headset itself with the volume balancer on the end, and the extension from that to USB male. The cable just from the headset to the online volume balanacer is about 5 ft. (FIVE FEET!?) and the volume balancer is at the END of that cable. The extension then plugs into the balancer and adds even more length before it terminates in a USB male end. The volume balancer is something I don't want and wish was optional, but if you use the headset USB, it has to be included; the proprietary non-USB connectors for plugging into the headset directly are the same for both the inline balancer cable and the extension cable, but the plastic molding around the cable end is specially shaped for the volume balancer cable, so only it will fit. Most headsets with some kind of volume control have it close to the headset so you can easily reach it with you hands while in use, bit this one is so long that for it to be practical, you have to bundle the cabling together and tie it. The volume balance dial on the cord is also super sensitive and moved around all the time time, as the cable is so long the balanacer dial can get dragged on the floor with normal use unless as tie up the cable as above. No braided cable at this price point, which is disappointing because I would much, MUCH preferred one long, braided cable to this two-cable monstrosity with a useless volume balancer. The PS4 even has a built-in software setting to balance chat and game volume, so this feature seems like something hastily thrown together to put on the box and I wish it was completely ommitted.

The mic is absolute garbage. I have to turn the mic volume all the way up, and even then it somehow picks up my MOUSE CLICKS better than my voice no matter what noise cancelling setting. Even with the mic right up against my mouth, it barely registers my voice and when it does it's super quiet and people have a hard time hearing me. This is somehow a step up from the headset I was using on PC, but on PS4, it is not an improvement from my RIG400 which is just a three-pole that plugs into the controller's streaming Bluetooth audio jack.

Do not buy this. I will give Steel Series kudos for not making you create an account with their adjustment software like Razer does, which is why I'll never use another Razer product. And the comfort on this is fine. I can wear it for extended periods of time with no discomfort. But every other aspect of this headset is a disappointment and I would never buy this product again. My products was also already opened when I got it, all of the seals were broke, which is cool. ;D

tl;dr
PROs
-Good Software
-Comfortable to wear

CONs
-Awful mic
-Volume balancer is useless and should have been omitted but is required for USB use
-No braided cable, and cable is needlessly long
-Volume balancer position makes it almost impossible to use without cinching the cabling up to shorten it"
June,1,Cheap Quality and Invasive Software,"Reviewed in the United States on December 14, 2023",Color: BlackStyle: Nova 3Verified Purchase,0,"I've had these for a few weeks now and at first I was just a little bit unhappy with them.
I have a separate microphone so I don't use the built in one. If I leave it unmuted it acts like an audio pass through which is very distracting. However if I use the mute button for some unknown reason my audio will cut in and out sometimes and has basically no noise canceling. Which is worse.
I was going to use them until I could get something better but then I received not one but two emails today.
One demanding to know why I wasn't using various options in the software and the other how i was liking others i was using. The one I don't use is a screen recording feature (I have Nvidia so I use that if I need to record a short video) and the other wanting to know how I enjoy the surround sound.
I dunno about you, but I do NOT enjoy the idea of my headset software keeping tabs on exactly what I do with it. It feels very invasive.

J. T.,1,Zero support for the engine required to actually get all advertised capacity. Avoid steelseries!,"Reviewed in the United States on September 28, 2023",Color: WhiteStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,"The company gives no effort into supporting any issues with the programming needed to actually get their devices to do what they advertise.

The steelseries engine gives me a fatal error each time it runs after the latest update, with NO way to stop it from updating daily to the latest (broken) version of software. They will NOT let you download an older functioning version of the software as it forces a daily check for updates which it then auto installs.

It used to ask to update but they deliberately removed that function. As if their product would never have an issue. The company also has NO phone support option at all just a broken ticket system via email.

When working their devices are great but if they have a hitch somewhere then kiss the hardware goodbye as far as fully functioning as anything besides a basic device.

My best advice to others is to skip the steelseries brand entirely and get a different product that has actual employees on the line that answer a phone in order to give you customer service."
Nicholas Warren,1,Problems with Windows,"Reviewed in the United States on December 26, 2023",Color: BlackStyle: Nova 3Verified Purchase,0,"I bought this for use on my PC running Windows 11. It has several serious problems.

Windows doesn't know what to do with this headset. Sounds always have serious static, especially when listening to music or during quiet parts in movies. It's as if it has to be playing some kind of sound and it fills the gaps with static. Some of this comes from the noise cancellation and can be fixed by keeping the microphone muted, but then there's no microphone...

The microphone starts transmitting sharp and loud static which is only fixed by unplugging the headset and plugging it back in over and over until it fixes itself.

I don't normally regret purchases, but I regret buying these headphones. Everyday I put them on is another day of wishing I'd bought anything else."

Rachel,1,Crackling/Popping and Skipping,"Reviewed in the United States on January 8, 2023",Color: BlackStyle: Nova 3Verified Purchase,0,"I tried this out for 2 days already knowing that these run on the smaller side. They barely fit me as a 5'4 Caucasian female. Even then the ear cuffs were just ever so slightly too small as well. These might be better suited to children than adults..

The biggest problem though was that there was constant crackling and popping whenever audio was playing. The only fox I found (which wasn't perfect) was turning you pc's computer volume up very high and lowering the sound volume on the headset a bit. Even then you may still hear it sometimes.

Also, if you were to watch a video like a let's play where the person is louder than the game audio or ASMR, I noticed that small sounds were cut off. Almost like you were listening to music that would skip a second or cut out, a lot!

Behind all the issues the audiovisual amazing with the arctis nova 3 and is light on your head, but unless you can deal with crackling/popping and skipping low audio, I don't recommend them.

For the price you are paying it feels like your getting a nice car only to look underneath and find it's rusted to all hell. It'll get you where you need to go for a bit but you really should return it while you can."

It comes with no explanation as to how to even open the interface once installed. Yes, you can figure it out...eventually. Do you have time or patience for that? Next, the sidetone that they say these headphones has does not work unless the software is installed and even then its jinky. One of their support people told me to turn on ""listen"" in Windows to make this work. This advice turned out to be totally wrong and makes echo, not sidetone. Next, do you enjoy plugging a usb device in every time you restart your computer? That's what you have to do to get the Engine software to recognize these headphones. The support is awful. It is clear they don't understand questions and do not have solves or documentation for common issues. It is 5 days later and I still don't have answers to 2 basic questions. Back to sidetone-with the help of a guy on youtube, I figured out a routine that can make the sidetone work but it is a routine. It takes time and fenaggling.

Great headphones
Comfortable
Good mic
Good sound
Good software

Bottom line is great product if it doesn’t break, but if it breaks and you didn’t buy it from steel series directly then there is no chance in getting a new headset.

DONT BUY UNLESS YOU HAVE MONEY TO GET A NEW ONE WHEN THE FIRST BREAKS AFTER A YEAR.

Support won't cover it.,"Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2022",Color: BlackStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,1,"I bought these headphones in August of 2021. They have been used often, but I treated them really well, retracting the mic when not in use, and hanging them on a stand. The mic is clear, and the sound quality is fine. However; the other day when I pulled out the mic, the plastic sleeve around the boom snapped. I contacted support to see if they would cover the failure. They gave me a blanket ""No"" response, saying they won't/can't repair it, there is no replacement part available for me to do it myself because the retractable mics are integrated into the earphone, and of course they didn't offer to replace the unit. For a touted ""feature,"" you'd expect it to not fail after so few cycles. Very frustrating.

You can jiggle it to get sound so it is an obvious short. I purchased the asurion protection thinking they would cover it, they wouldn't. So don't waste your money on their service. They just directed me to the manufacturer. I went to the manufacturer who wanted me to jump through hoops to see if they would cover this under warranty. I finally got fed up with the whole process. Steel Series warranty process is too complex and time consuming. Not what I expected being the customer who received a faulty product and definitely not what I expected when I purchased a protection plan. Save your money and buy a headset from a different manufacturer."
Kathy Posey,1,Arctis 5 crapped out 7 months in cause an app update decided to crap it's self.,"Reviewed in the United States on July 12, 2020",Color: BlackStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,"First 7 months, great. Best pair of headphones you could get sub-100 bucks, easily. Not the most comfortable, but mic and audio quality is unmatched.

Past week has been a nightmare.

The proprietary software that you HAVE to use to get the most out the talking points of this headset, just refuses to read the Arctis 5 anymore after the last update. Everything but the SteelSeries Engine 3 reads them. Discord still picks them up as ""Arctis 5 Certified"", SSE3 just demands me to reconnect them and refuses to let anything work outside of basic functionality. I've reconnected them multiple times, uninstalled the drivers, reinstalled them through SSE3, reinstalled them through the SteelSeries website, I've tried just about everything I can think of or look up. The main reasons why you'd buy this headset, may just not work depending on if the update gods like you or not and you'll have to wait till the next update to hopefully see if they work again or not cause the SteelSeries Engine 3 app just doesn't let you rollback to a previous version.

All I want is a properly working, complete noise cancellation mic on a headset because I live in a very loud house. And without SSE3 working properly, these things can pick up me barely dragging my finger against my mousepad, as if I was dragging it along the mic. The hell"
Amazon Customer,1,Worst Customer Service I have ever dealt with,"Reviewed in the United States on January 15, 2021",Color: WhiteStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,"The headset was good and all but the fact that SteelSeries customer service is so scammy is beyond me. They have made so much money off of these headsets by now that all that I needed replaced was a cord (which costs them barely anything compared to the headset themselves). I have had the headset for not even a few weeks and the response I get is ""we do not replaced damaged"" even though if anything its a cord problem not a damage problem. The cords not working is a result of them being plugged into one another. If anything that is more how they are designed. The result of how they were made caused it not me using the headset because I did not break them they just stopped plugging in after a while. That should be on you guys. Regardless, them saying that to a new customer should not be how you handle this. Then to not even get a response after shows the kind of company they are. They also have no good way to get in touch with them no number or anything you ""submit a ticket"" or ""try talking to a representative"" which that one I feel you don't get a response from anyway. All around, that is essentially what you will run into so I advise staying away."

The very long cable has been noted in reviews as a nuisance, but with this second purchase it was quickly apparent that the quality of the long cable is much diminished. It quickly twisted up, into a mess of tangled knots. This persisted even when I used hair ties to try to contain the mess. The twists and knotting stress the cable to the point of almost breaking. I am having to buy a replacement cable directly from the company. I will not be buying this brand again."

Contacted Manufacture and they will not due to anything either stating and I quote ""As our earpads are able to be placed back on the headset, we are unable to provide a replacement unit."" The problem is that earpad shouldn't have fallen off that easy and most likely will keep falling off since it will not be as tight as originally should have been.

My first pair suddenly stopped working after about three weeks. I got a replacement from amazon, which stopped working after about five weeks. Amazon told me I was out of the purchase protection date and to contact manufacturer.

I did and after going through their entire claims process, it was started over for zero reason. I submitted a followup asking what the deal was and got a message back saying my message couldn't be received because the company had closed the ticket.

Long story short, this company is terrible. I think they're just trying to push me out of the warranty date at this point. I have received zero help from them. Gigantic waste of time and money. Honestly, a part of me is glad this has all gone so terribly. They were only offering a replacement or equivalent purchase and, based off of this experience, I don't see me buying or using any of their products ever again. I could not be more displeased with the product or the company. I'd advise everyone here to pay a bit more and stay away from these people."
Chris Phillips,1,Do not purchase!,"Reviewed in the United States on September 14, 2020",Color: BlackStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,"The headset is great, but my one star comes down to a major design flaw, one that leaves me without sound and shopping for a new headset at this very moment. The headset cable! This is a rare cable that is only used in Nikon camera's and provides audio and power to the headset. It would seem cats love the texture of this cable and naw through the cord so I found myself needing to purchase a new cable, so I contact steelseries and they have been out of stock for the past 10 weeks. Steelseries created a proprietary cable so you can only buy from them and never have any stock and by proprietary I do not mean the connectors themselves but how the cable is made to fit in the headset. Another thing I was greatly disappointed in was the costumer service rep they tried to fool you into thinking they are real but just another chat bot, once your questions get just a tad bit complex the bot craps all over it's self and starts giving you some really funny replies that have nothing to do with the problem, that was the only enjoyment I got from this experience."

The jack is causing an issue where static can be heard in my chat. I can also hear it when running a test on my own headset. It is awful and piercing. This is my second broken headset with SteelSeries. My first lasted approximately one year and we did not bother with the warranty process after looking into it. After looking into the 2 year warranty-- they are way far behind on tickets it seems and looking into other people's experience with the warranty process it seems to be shoddy and lengthy with some waiting between 30 days to a year to get a replacement after a lengthy and costly process (shipping fees). I've opened a ticket for this problem this time but we will probably just purchase something elsewhere and give up on Steel Series as a company because of this. Bummer. Don't waste your money on a product that the company hardly stands behind and doesn't offer a reasonable process to replace faulty items. That is taking a big gamble on an electronic!

Something is messed up in the cable. Anyways, it got continually worse at 6 months, and now it doesn't work at all. So I bought it from SteelSeries on Amazon. Sent in a refund request yesterday since it was within their 1 year guarantee on their website. Got a reply back a few minutes ago that says they can't do anything about it because I'm outside the 30-day refund period.....So if you buy their product from their website you get a minimum 1 year guarantee.

Steelseries customer service not helpful. It takes a few days for them to respond to everything. Their first response will always be: uninstall Steelseries Engine 3 then install it again with new drivers. I even told them in my first ticket that I tried this but sure enough, that was their response. Dealing with them is definitely something I do not wish to do again.

This dumb thing can control the volume and its so sensetive sometimes while gaming it will just auto turn the volume while you're playing because its most likely gonna be on the floor due to how big bulky and annoying it is..Alongside this theres a volume adjuster on the sides of the headphones?? WHY why are there two volume things? This alongside the mic alongside how uncomfortable these are i would say stay away and never buy these.

Part of the issue is it separates volume into two channels - chat and gaming. and this slider on the cord controls BOTH but opposite... turn one up the other goes down.... would be nice to have a mixer if it wasn't in the middle of a 10 foot cord with extremely high sensitivity.

Over two months and a ton of messages to the support team through both email and chat, multiple times, is absolutely unacceptable. I will never buy steeleseries again because of this experience.

The headphones themselves are ok. Better quality than wireless headphones you can get for 100 dollars for sure. But, if you're using them for a PlayStation, it's more of a hassle than it's worth honestly. Spend the extra money and get a higher end wireless headphone."

On this one, a couple of plastic tabs popped out when trying to adjust the headband part of the headset. They didn't really go back in thereafter, which made it a no-brainer to send them back. Sound quality was okay, but I've had < $50 headphones that were superior, so I'm not sure these sound good enough given the price. The lights were definitely cool."
Jack,1,Broke after a while barely lasted,"Reviewed in the United States on July 25, 2022",Color: BlackStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,The sound quality was horrible and the mic was also trash I kept having to talk to customer support which was even worse. The mic was so bad sounded like a jet engine on the other side and the software for the mic was even worse.
Deb A,1,1/10 not worth the money,"Reviewed in the United States on March 3, 2021",Color: BlackStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,"I am so tired of companies that make light up products not telling you from the jump THE LIGHTS ONLY WORK WHEN CONNECTED VIA USB TO A PC THEY WILL NOT WORK WITH A NORMAL ASS PS4

I think these headphones are okayish the cable is weird and they where awfully expensive for the lights too not work.

Over all 1/10 would spend my money elsewhere most definitely!"
KuKluxKlan,1,It broke,"Reviewed in the United States on January 28, 2023",Color: BlackStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,"It doesn't work well, It was broken since I got it. And then the moment it finally got past the return date. It completely stopped working."
Amazon Customer,1,"Dont Buy, Stay away from product for price.","Reviewed in the United States on December 9, 2018",Color: BlackStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,"First off the price does not resemble the product. Cord is too short for starters and forces you to use a big bulky, and heavy chat dial that doesnt work properly, just to be able to have enough length. Secondly and most importantly, the sound quality is Bad/Trash, again not worth the price. Third off, the Mic also doesnt work that well and sometimes not at all. What noise cancellations ? Honestly it Looks like it will break all the way in 2-3 months after purchase."
Raven Grey,1,THESE DO NOT WORK FOR XBOX,"Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2022",Color: BlackStyle: Nova 3Verified Purchase,0,These DO NOT WORK FOR XBOX EVEN THO TBE MANUAL SAYS IT DOES. The light on mine also did not work! Will be returning these! What a waste!!
Joseph b.,1,Dont not buy these for xbox!!!!!!,"Reviewed in the United States on June 14, 2020",Color: BlackStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,"If you have an Xbox or playstation i would not recommend these. Did the update online for them and gave them a solid 15hrs of play time trying to tweak them to make them sound good, and to make me sound good and could never get them to work properly. Mic is always cutting out, no matter what settings i change. Highly recommend going with an xbox or playstation verified product."
Eduardo A.,1,Perfect for gaming and music / They stopped working.,"Reviewed in the United States on July 6, 2021",Color: BlackStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,"I bought 2 and both work perfectly... I'm using them for gaming, TV, and music.

Update (January 2023): Both headsets stopped working (right side) after a year and a half.; the same side in both of them.

Think twice before buying this headset, you will lose your money in around 1 year."
matthew,1,WORST SOUND QUALITY EVER,"Reviewed in the United States on July 22, 2020",Color: BlackStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,"Do not be fooled by the lovely design of this headset, it is quite literally the worst audio quality I have ever heard. It sounds equivalent to two large tin cans over your ears and nothing I could do was adjusting the sound quality of this headset. DO NOT BUY. Spend your 100 dollars elsewhere. My biggest regret is not returning them immediately to get my money back."
rachelle,1,BREAKS IN DAYS.,"Reviewed in the United States on December 8, 2022",Color: BlackStyle: Nova 3Verified Purchase,0,"This headset stoped working on one side in the 11 whole days we had it. Awful, and I will be returning it."
Megan Mueller,1,Stopped working in 1 month,"Reviewed in the United States on February 27, 2021",Color: WhiteStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,"They stopped working after 1 month!
Amazon return policy is a joke they won't exchange them.
The manufacturer is even worse. There is NO phone number to call it takes weeks for them to respond to an email and because I bought them on Amazon they won't exchange them either.
Don't waste your money!"
Vic,1,Main wire was chewed up,"Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2019",Color: BlackStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,1,"The Arctis 5 felt very comfortable when I put it on but when I looked at my main wire it was chewed up. It looked like a dog had gotten to it and just chewed it. Box looks good and so does the headset, just not the wire. And yes I bought this used but they should have checked and replaced the item that was broken. I'm very disappointed."
Buyer,1,Stopped working after a month.,"Reviewed in the United States on April 23, 2023",Color: BlackStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,The mic stopped working after about a month. Not recommended at all.
Amazon Customer,1,Microphone volume is way to low,"Reviewed in the United States on October 8, 2022",Color: BlackStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,Even after downloading the software and upping the mic volume no one can hear me. Terrible software and hardware
Monzer,1,DON'T BUY FROM AMAZON,"Reviewed in the United States on March 26, 2021",Color: BlackStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,"The headset is great for the price, but something happened with the microphone quality and now it sounds bad. It is under warranty however steelseries will not cover it because I did not purchase it from their website. Makes no sense which is a shame cause it's a nice headset."
Philip Y.,1,quality control issue -- completely died after 13 months -- one month after warranty expired,"Reviewed in the United States on July 18, 2020",Color: BlackStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,"this was for my son. he loved it. after 13 months or purchase, the entire headset died. i could not get a refund or replacement from amazon because of warranty expiration. dealing with manufacturer directly, but not hopeful. wow, after spending $100 on a headphone, one should expect it to last more. live and learn."
Matthew Judd,1,Stopped working after 5 days of use,"Reviewed in the United States on April 26, 2020",Color: BlackStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,"It was fine for what it is, the two different outputs for chat vs game with a dial to change balance was interesting. Used it for gaming with Discord for less than a week, stopped working in the middle of play and I couldn't get it to work again. Rebooted, plugged into another slot, not interested in playing around with it anymore."
North,1,Not worth the price,"Reviewed in the United States on January 2, 2021",Color: BlackStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,"I ordered this product a while back, and loved it at first. The RGB is cool, the sound quality is average and the dual channel system is a nice touch. They started cutting out randomly for a few weeks, then died all together. Not worth your money. I would recommend Logitech or HyperX instead."
Caroline Wilson,1,Don't buy,"Reviewed in the United States on December 28, 2020",Color: BlackStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,"I bought these headphones twice. I don't know why. The first time the mic broke within a week, I returned them. The new pair lasted about two months, but the mic broke once again. Also, the audio would randomly stop coming out of one ear. Don't buy these faulty headphones."
Bryan,1,OVER HYPED. Not really worth it over RAZERs,"Reviewed in the United States on June 5, 2020",Color: WhiteStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,1,"NOT IMPRESSED. I figured I'd give these a try. I've owned Razer headsets in the past I've enjoyed those ones alot. I honestly just go with one of those. They have better bass though their mics aren't as ""GOOD"" supposedly. Am not trying to sound harsh but they're not worth they're price point in my opinion. Thats just me."
Kindle Customer,1,Poor quality if they don't replace it,"Reviewed in the United States on February 8, 2019",Color: BlackStyle: Arctis 5Verified Purchase,0,Got this for my son and it's not used on a regular basis and just like that one speaker isn't working in his headphone and the date to return or exchange was just a week ago. Kinda pissed that when I went looking for reviews to buy a set for him that this was highly recommended and I tried calling Amazon which the recording just said call back later because we're busy.
