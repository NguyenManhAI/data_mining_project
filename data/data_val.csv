Green Mario,2,01/02/2023,10ft - Black,Nope.,Probably the worst-quality thing I've ever bought with an Anker brand stamp on it. These cables didn't last 2 weeks before they started cutting in and out. The only reason I'm giving them a two-star instead of a one-star rating is because it's Anker and maybe I just got a bum cable.,1,Negative
Ann,5,01/10/2024,Mercury White,"Pretty, simple, and great quality!","I own this mouse in both colors now and use it everyday for both gaming and schoolwork. After using my black one for about 1 1/2 years, I can say I've had no issues. The light up detail on the mouse is pretty and matches my new setup- it's white on the white mouse and green on the black mouse.

The two side buttons are useful as key binds in many games and to go back and forth with webpages and I'm happy there isn't a DPI button near the scroll wheel- no accidental DPI changes. The mouse also has a slightly matte texture on the top which makes using it enjoyable. Not a very heavy mouse, is a good size for an average length hand.",1,Positive
Matthew DeClue,4,04/19/2023,Black - Arctis 5,Great sound and durable,"3rd set I've owned, not sure I'd buy a different brand again. 1st 2 sets have lasted a great while. Only complaint is that the elastic band looses its tightness and you can't adjust it enough to keep up over time.",0,Positive

Bee,5,11/21/2023,Classic Black,"Cheap, but a deathadder!","I have had two other Deathadder mouses. This is the lightest, cheapest one. The cord is regular plastic instead of nice braid. It's a budget price for a budget mouse. I will gladly use it until I make sure to buy a more expensive one next time. I recommend it based on the price point, but a higher quality model is better from Razer.",0,Positive
Glenn@Memphis,5,12/01/2024,10ft - Black,Durable and well made but…,Durable and well made but invest in a high output charger to pare with this charging cable.  If used with lower output chargers it may not charge well.  G@Tn.,1,Positive

Julian Johnson,5,10/25/2023,Black - Nova 3,Quality,Bought on sale and not disappointed. Use it to play games in house before my five kids are up.

Laurel K,5,04/23/2020,Black - Arctis 5,Love these headphones,"I use these headphones to game, talk with friends online, and steam videos. The quality of the sound is excellent and the headphones themselves are comfortable. I can wear them for several hours at a time without issue. Some nice features are the retractable mic, volume control behind the ear, and the knob to control game over voice volume ratio. I also like that these headphones can either be USB or headphone jack compatible. I haven't really tried using the wireless feature of the headphones. So i don't know how good they are in that department. I think the only negative is i wish the adjustment straps were a bit different. I personally don't like the design of them as they can come unattached easily. Despite this, i've been using these headphones for quite a while now and I love them. I use them for everything I do online. They're comfortable and the sounds quality is great. These are exactly what I needed.",0,Positive

Jacob Birmingham,1,22/02/2024,10ft - Black,Lasted maybe a month,"I’ve had a lot of luck with other anker products, but not their 10’ c-c cable. Very flimsy. Had about a week out of the box before it became flimsy, then once flimsy it had to be plugged in at a certain angle in order to charge anything for about 2-3 weeks. Doesn’t charge anything now.

chris,5,12/03/2024,10ft - Silver,Great product by anker and I use it for everything,"Great cable. I mainly use this for my PC charger to another Anker 100W charger. I also sometimes use this for my ipad/iphone or other usb-c device. It charges everything and is a very multiversatile cable. You can get them in different lengths, but the 10ft one is good for laptop. If you get a Anker charger and use this cable it saves so much space compared to the laptop chargers that are huge and bricky.",1,Positive
martin rogers,4,12/13/2022,Black - Arctis 5,"Only one complaint, location of the mixer on the cord.",Good sound. Good comfort. Good durability. Only issue is the location of the mixer on the cord. For my setup it falls to floor level and the dial can inadvertently catch and the chat is gone without me realizing it while in the midst of playing.,0,Positive
Peter Tozzi,2,11/06/2023,10ft - Black,be careful,make sure you unplug it properly often I’ve had it for almost 9 months and it doesn’t work anymore. This is now the second type of cord for lightning cable for my iPhone that I’ve had problems with.,1,Negative
Galen,3,01/19/2024,Classic Black,You can't change the color scheme.,"In the highly competitive world of gaming mice It is very surprising to me that Razer would choose to lock you out of the color settings if you purchase the death adder. Essential. As far as functionality goes, The mouse does exactly what it supposed to do. But you will need to download the razer software And create a new profile for the mouse to function properly.",0,Negative
Bob,5,12/07/2023,Black - Nova 3,SteelSeries New Arctis Nova 3 Multi-Platform Gaming Headset,Just what I was looking for. Some headphones are hard to wear because they start hurting my ears.

Andi,5,06/12/2020,Black - Arctis 5,Like Magic,"I have never had such a good pair of headphones. The sound quality is crystal clear. I'm hearing sound effects I never knew were in my games. They have amazing 360 degree sounds so you can hear sound from all directions in a game, especially the location of enemy footsteps.

The sound quality is so good that it rivals a studio headset for listening to music. Sounds are vivid and not compressed.

The noise cancelation is so good that I can't hear a single sound, not even my own voice. A plane could probably crash in my kitchen and I wouldn't hear it. The setting that plays your voice back for you through the headphones is required if you're talking to anyone, as you can't hear yourself.

The microphone is amazing. The adjustable distance lets you set it to the perfect range. My friends have no issue hearing me and it sounds like I'm in the same room as them. I especially like the red light on top that lets me know that I'm muted.

The wires are a little too long for my liking. It takes some weaving it around behind my pc to get it to a reasonable length, but it's okay.

Overall, these are amazing.",0,Positive

Phil,2,06/25/2023,Mercury White,Busted mouse wheel,"I've been a big fan of the ergonomics of the deathadders for years, but it's clear that Razer doesn't know how to design a functional mousewheel. If something is to fail on them, it's always the mousewheel, and in the case of this one, it failed in a hurry. Within 2 months it developed a habit of scrolling in the opposite direction of where I was spinning. Razer support claims it's a dust problem and it's fixable with a quick burst of an air duster. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. But should I really have to spray my mouse with a can of air every time I want to scroll a page?

Probably the last Razer mouse I'll buy.",0,Negative
Morgan,2,08/23/2023,Classic Black,Not so great,"I am thoroughly disappointed with the Essential Gaming Mouse with a 6400 DPI Optical Sensor. This product has proven to be a major letdown in terms of its performance, build quality, and overall functionality, making it a frustrating and unsatisfactory gaming accessory.

First and foremost, the performance of the gaming mouse is severely lacking. Despite its claim of having a 6400 DPI optical sensor, the accuracy and responsiveness of the sensor are far from impressive. The mouse often exhibits erratic tracking and inconsistent cursor movement, making it virtually impossible to achieve precise aiming and control in games.

The build quality of the gaming mouse is also questionable. The materials used feel cheap and flimsy, and the overall construction does not inspire confidence in its durability. The mouse's buttons and scroll wheel lack a satisfying tactile feedback and feel unreliable during gameplay.

Moreover, the ergonomic design of the mouse is uncomfortable for extended use. The shape and contours do not provide proper support for the hand, leading to discomfort and strain during prolonged gaming sessions. This significantly hampers the overall gaming experience.

The customization options for the gaming mouse are limited and lack user-friendly software support. Customizing buttons, DPI settings, and macros should be intuitive and convenient, but the software provided with the mouse fails to deliver a seamless experience.

Furthermore, the product's performance in games with fast-paced action is particularly disappointing. The mouse's sluggish response and lack of accuracy make it ill-suited for competitive gaming scenarios, which defeats the purpose of an ""essential"" gaming mouse.

The price paid for this gaming mouse is far from justified considering the poor performance, subpar build quality, and lack of comfort it offers. I expected a product that would enhance my gaming experience, but I received a subpar accessory that only detracts from it.

In conclusion, the Essential Gaming Mouse with a 6400 DPI Optical Sensor is a significant disappointment due to its poor performance, uncomfortable design, lack of customization, and overall lack of value. If you're seeking a gaming mouse that delivers accurate tracking, comfort, and customization options for an immersive gaming experience, I strongly advise looking elsewhere for a product that offers better quality, functionality, and value for your money.",0,Negative

Guinis Lornet,2,15/02/2024,10ft - Red,Fails,"My original MBP 16"" 2019 cable blew out, so I picked this up. It worked for maybe 9 months and then it started dropping charge a few times then charging. Today, a year and a half after purchase, it no longer charged my MBP. Originally it was around $50, now it's at $10-30. Suggest avoiding this cable.",1,Negative
Terry Riner,5,12/19/2022,Black - Nova 3,"Another victory, another Steel Series","The best price to performance wired option for spatial audio and competitive gaming.

The Good:
Works with every device via 3.5 (aux) or USB.
Plenty of included cord length.
Great noise-canceling mic
Exceptional Almighty spatial audio (the highs, mids, and lows are all very present and accounted for).
Excellent build quality.
Durable and easily adjusted.
Customization: Leds and EQ tunings using the software on PC.

The Neutral
At this price a wired headset should include a case, stand, or something—anything really.
The bass is average when not using custom preset on PC and it's lacking over 3.5.
The 40mm Steel Series drivers (like all their headsets) would all be better if they were larger (50mm).
It's average at cancelling other noises around you (ie busy traffic, barking dog, etc.)

The bad:
Usb and internal DAC as well as LEDs don't work on Xbox. (You can plug up the USB wasting a port just to get the lighting, but why?)

You might as well buy the Arctis Nova 1's if you don't have a device to take advantage of the USB connection. If you have multiple devices and most (or the primary) can use the USB, then this is the best option (at this price point).

If you want Hi-Fi audio, then the Arctis Nova Pro Wired is what you want (probably the best cans I've owned that's both decent at scratching the audiophile itch and delivering exceptional gaming audio―everything just sounds better!)

For wireless there's the new Nova 7's which are great, but if you want to have two systems hooked up simultaneously I highly recommend the Nova Pro Wireless.

I love the new Nova lineup, but I do believe SS needs to start offer larger drivers, include more accesories, or charge Less. I will be reviewing the Nova Pro as well.

Thanks for reading!

Chris,5,15/01/2024,10ft - Silver,The long cable that works with iPhone,It works without getting an error message on the iPhone.  Use with 5v 20W and 30W USB-C wall charger for best performance.,1,Positive
Kurt,5,12/20/2021,Black - Arctis 5,Great headphones for noise suppression,I bought these headphones for the DTS support as well as the noise cancelling material and I have not been let down. The noise cancelling is perfect. You can hear things going on outside the headphones just enough to know if something going on but not enough to interfere with gaming. The DTS support works perfectly and I cannot complain about it. These are some of the better gaming headphones in this price range and I cannot recommend them and other steel series products enough.,0,Positive

Amazon Customer,2,09/30/2022,Mercury White,"Scroll wheel dies after 2 months, not worth it, look elsewhere","The mouse was perfect for me, but the scroll wheel decided it's time to not work anymore after only 2 months of use.
At first, I noticed it was being a little weird every now and then (jumping long lengths with just one flick up or down, once in a while) about a month in. Now I scroll one direction only and get no where because the scroll fluctuates up & down rapidly, 2 months in, completely infuriating and practically useless. Huge bummer since I'm very careful & gentle with everything I own (I've never once broken phones, mouse, keyboards, etc).
I was ready to accept it was just my experience, perhaps just one unfortunate faulty mouse that I was unlucky to receive, but after doing research about my issue I've come to find out this is a common issue for this mouse. If I would've known, I would've gotten a different mouse that didnt have this common issue. Not worth the money or hassle, even if it is cheap, just save your money for something more reliable! :(
No photos because the mouse appears fine physically, and gave 2 stars instead of 1 because besides the scroll wheel, it works fine. But a broken scroll wheel is such a detriment to it's entire purpose, imo.",0,Negative

D. L. Willis,5,12/12/2023,Classic Black,Over a year and still going strong.,I have had it for over a year... and it survived a very close lightning strike.. so close that it shocked and numbed my hand through the mouse.

Derek Atwood,3,04/24/2023,Classic Black,"I've owned a lot of these, but not for the reason you're thinking","I've burned through many DeathAdders. It was my first ever gaming mouse, and I stuck with it for a while up until recently. These mice always last me only about a year before the sides start chipping off, cause they're a rubber material. The scroll wheel always ends up going haywire after a while (reverse of what you want it to do.) At one point I had a deathadder that didn't register every left click.

Graphics Guy,2,10/26/2022,Classic Black,It downloads Spyware on your computer!,"OK, technically not Spyware, but about as legally close as you can get to spyware. The software has a keyboard logger and according to their EUA they can log anything you type and use it for anything they want. Hmmm, seems like spyware. Also, I notice that my gaming FPS performance goes down when I use this mouse, probably due to the software.

To completely remove the offending software, I had to go into Device Manager and find it under Human Interface Software. Not easy.

I'm throwing this mouse into the trash and buying another from a more reputable manufacture.",0,Negative

Arthur T.,4,06/21/2023,Classic Black,It's good but the mousewheel requires frequent cleaning,"I like everything about this mouse except that the mousewheel develops a jitter when it gets dirty, which happens at pretty frequent intervals (a couple of weeks).

AmazonBuyer,4,04/05/2021,10ft - Black,Nice Long Cables with Tacky Logo on Plug,"These are some of the nicest cables I own, I only wish that the Anker logo on the plug was less obvious. If it was molded in the plug or was a grey less noticeable ink that would be cool. The white ink on the black plug just looks tacky. I always turn over the plug so I don't see it.

wolfe,2,01/02/2024,Classic Black,glitches after a few months,"If I had written this review when this first came in - it would have been 5 stars. I bought one of these, and after a few months the scroll wheel on top stopped working effectively, and the screen hops up when scrolling down. I tried to submit a claim but the process to claim is terrible. They want a video of the glitch. It wasn't worth it for me to figure out how to take a video showing me scrolling down and the screen going up, so I cut my losses and just bought a second one assuming the first was a fluke. Now, a few months later on my new one, the same issue is happening. Great mouse, if you don't use the scroll wheel. I've abandoned ship and moved on to a different brand at this rate. Disappointing.",0,Negative

Patrick,2,09/21/2023,Mercury White,Absolutely terrible.,I figure I'd try this out after my other Razer Mamba mouse died. It's completely cheap plastic and with no rubber grips.

Chase Wilkinson,5,06/09/2023,Black - Arctis 5,"Quality, Comfort and Looks","Exactly what I wanted!
Can't express how pleased I am with my new headset. I was using the Arctis 7 for the past 6 years and tried to upgrade to the wired pro, which was nice but right out of the box the mute button was oversized, not supported correctly, making it stick and not work. I tried the Logitech G Pro, but didn't like the feel of them. Then I found the Arctis 5 wired, which has all of the same quality, sound and performance of the Arctis 7 ""including the mute button"". The enhanced features are the light weight comfort of the headset and the Game/Chat dial is at my finger tips instead of on the back of the head set. I also love the added lit illuminating feature on the headset, it pairs perfect with my illuminated Razor mouse and keyboard. Very happy with this purchase",0,Positive
Chris,3,09/24/2023,Mercury White,Do not scroll too much with this mouse,"Had the mouse for about 6 months maybe 7. Scroll wheel just went out today and now can spin infinitely and the warranty window they offer is very small so I wasn't able to get any support or replacement part from them. Is it a decent mouse for gaming? Sure but not if you are a competitive player. So if you plan on getting a mouse for heavy use just go with the G305 lightspeed, it will save you more time and money in the long run.",0,Negative
Daniel W,1,11/22/2023,Classic Black,Just another mouse without always logging into a Razer online account,"This is a nice mouse as far as quality of materials and comfort. The scroll wheel friction is a good compromise between free movement and control, though I prefer a little more spin. There is no adjustment. The buttons activate with very light pressure and have a distinctive click sound which you can hear and feel providing positive feedback. Basic decent mouse, full stop. To do all the other things that you are paying good money for you need an active online account to manage the ""cloud"" profile. So to control the lighting, set functions, program macros etc, you must be online. You can do some of this with a guest account, but they still collect your data for which Razer knows who the owner is. Synapse 3 no longer offers an ""offline"" mode that was available with version 2, and yes, this affects all Razer products.",0,Negative

Noah,2,02/18/2024,Mercury White,Cheap,"Got this mouse thinking, ""oh it's razer it'll be good"" well it's not. It WAS good, but after 2 days the mouse wheel became near unusable. Scroll up, it scrolls down. It's a cheap mouse with a good chance off it crapping out sooner than later. Don't let the brand fool you.",0,Negative
Michelle,5,09/12/2023,10ft - Red,Relaible Anker,"Anker has always been my go-to brand for chargers, cables, and power adapters. They are reliable, high-quality, and well worth the money. This experience was no different than my others.The braded cable is sturdy and thick, as a 10-ft cable should be. To my surprise, Anker included a little velcro cable tie in the box. I was pretty excited to see that since cable management can become a pain with longer ones. I worry rolling and weaving a cable around itself may cause damage over time, so this alleviated the concern a bit. Unfortunately, it did not last very long. I imagine it wore down a bit faster due to my handling and the braded material of the cable itself. It was still an extra touch not seen from other companies.It works very well and I have had no issues with it. I was a little annoyed how every small electronic seems to be transitioning to USB-C, but at least Anker is around to provide the cables I need.",1,Positive

sarah,1,03/05/2022,10ft - Silver,broke for no reason after ~15 minutes,"This product completely stopped charging about 15 minutes into using it for the first time. I'm not sure if this was just a defective cord, or if they are all so short-lived, but it just completely stopped working. And nothing at all had even changed to trigger it??? My laptop & I were sitting still, minding our own business when the charging connection stopped. And y'all, not even my desperate attempts at twisting it into other angles made the connection start work again. Please, please save your money for something that will (a) charge your laptop, (b) bring you joy, or (c) all of the above.",1,Negative
Nicole,4,09/08/2022,Mercury White,Uhm I asked for white,"Wrong color…I ordered the white one but to my surprise, the black one was sent instead :( I won’t bother doing a return/exchange since it’s such a hassle. But putting the wrong color aside, this is a great mouse especially for the price!",0,Positive
will,3,10/17/2022,Classic Black,Gamers think twice,"For $20 I got a working mouse. I would never consider the mouse for any gaming. It's big, heavy, and hard to pick up to reset position on the mousepad. With this, you pay for a cheap mouse, and get a cheap mouse. This does not compete with higher priced options, but for 20 bucks it's a decent choice.",0,Positive
Dillon,1,08/11/2023,10ft - Black,No data transfer possible,I bought this for tethering to my laptop all my other cords work not this one. Stay far away from this item unless you only need to charge a phone.,1,Negative
Tatsman,1,14/07/2023,10ft - Black,Doesn't do 100 watts,Have had these cables for a while. Have a 747 charger from anker and these cables. Plugged it into both of my 555 power stations in the 100 watt charging port and the cable doesn't do 100 watts.,1,Negative
brek,1,06/01/2024,10ft - Red,Didn't last a year,"Cable no longer reliably charges. Checked my order history and was surprised to see the ""name brand"" cable has the issue while my generic cables are still going strong",1,Negative
Edward Panyalath,3,05/03/2022,Classic Black,Average Gaming mouse,"Mouse works fine with plenty of dpi options so you can make this thing pretty fast if you want.

My main negative is that I've had it for 2 weeks and it is having scroll wheel issues already so that is a big disappointment, but other than that the mouse is decent for the cheap price.",0,Positive
Samantha,5,20/02/2024,6.6FT+6.6FT - GreyNumber of Items: 2,GREAT VALUE,super long cords! great durability and charge my phone faster than any other charger I have (even the one that came with the phone!),1,Positive
Smevans,5,07/02/2024,6.6FT+6.6FT - GreyNumber of Items: 2,it works,First time buying charging cords with this end. I do like it because I can still watch stuff while it is charging my phone. And it is a fast charging one also.  I will probably buy a couple more in the near future to have when we need them.,1,Positive
T,5,10/01/2024,10ft - Black,Charges super fast,These charge iPad so fast I had to buy more for other rooms in the house.  Highly recommend if you are wanting a fast charge for your iPhone or iPad.,1,Positive
Paul W. Jones,4,27/04/2022,10ft - Black,"Good sturdy cable, if a bit pricey and slow","Anker products are generally very good quality, sometimes having better strain relief and consequently higher duty cycle than standard Apple cables (which can also be pretty pricey).  In a way, it is a get what you pay for sort of proposition.  The 10 foot version of this cable only supports USB 2.  I use this on a spare USB-C charger (also from Anker) on an iPad Pro (2021), works fine.  The main thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars is that it is not USB 3 or 4.  The 100W rating is a definite plus, though overkill for an iPad.",1,Positive
Scott Forbes,5,19/01/2024,10ft - Black,Exactly what you need for the future cords,This is a C to C cord. Wanted an extra cord for my laptop which uses C and the adapter is a C. Plus the nice sturdy design with nylon makes me confident that this will last a long time. Plus the length is nice if your power supply or outlet is far.Some color would have been nice but it’s different color than my other nylon cords so it’s easy to spot fortunately.,1,Positive

Austin,5,10/07/2023,Black - Arctis 5,Best bang for your buck,"I've bought 3 pairs of the Arctis 5, one for me and a pair for each of my two brothers as a present. I recently upgraded to a pair of Artics Nova Pro Wireless and it solidified how awesome these are for the price (especially when you can get them on sale). The sound quality is awesome and the mic quality is probably as good as some stand-alone streaming microphones if you tune it well in Steel Series GG.

All in all, if you're looking for a solid gaming headset you really can't beat this for the price.",0,Positive
Mario,2,11/17/2023,Classic Black,Decent But…,"Overall feel of the mouse, is smooth, crisp and precise. After around a month, the right click in games would stutter when I would aim down sights. Later, when turning fast in game, the mouse would fail to register the movement and stutter. It was good but slowly failed.",0,Negative
NiRC,3,05/03/2023,Classic Black,Not a good mouse,"Bizarre all the good reviews for this thing but perhaps I just got unlucky. For me it lasted about 5 months and the scroll wheel has just decided to take a dump. Scrolling up or down faster than one step a second makes it jitter around the opposite way. I use this PC primarily for programming and web but I do game and It's just not a good gaming mouse either for the same reason. Other than that it's great, it fits the hand well, it's good for small or large hands, it feels good, great response--but, it's also a wired mouse. Great response should be a given. An operational scroll wheel should also be a given for a $25 wired mouse. Not happy with this purchase and won't buy again.

UPDATE: After throwing the mouse against the wall in anger, the scroll wheel operates as it should once again.",0,Negative

zach,4,12/07/2022,Black - Nova 3,Good but,"I liked the feel and the sound of the Mic. Sidenote feedback was awesome but people I was talking to (confirmed by mic settings) said i would fade in amd out if I was not talking directly into the mic, I think its due to the mic ANC",0,Positive
