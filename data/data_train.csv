Amazon Customer,4,10/22/2022,Classic Black,Worked good for a while.,"Bought this about a year or so ago 2 of them for me and my S.O, worked great. The last month for some reason when I scroll (fast or slow) the scroll wheel will go down for a bit then immediately scroll back up a bit then down and up. My S.O's went at the same time, I've cleaned it and tried trouble shooting, I just assume its faulty, but still a good deal.",0,Positive

MRH57,5,11/02/2024,6.6FT+6.6FT - GreyNumber of Items: 2,Great design,"When using a standard straight USB-C charging port on my phone, if I was lounging in bed, the cable would start to fail after a month or two since the cord would bend in the direction of the wall outlet.  This design solves that problem since the plug can be inserted into a USB-C charging port with the cable directed in the direction of the outlet. It is a fantastic solution to a common problem that I have experienced with multiple brands of charging cables.",1,Positive

Priyansh Vats,3,01/18/2024,Classic Black,The mouse specifically is not that bad or very good.,"The mouse is not very bad, It's good for gaming but only if you're starting out because, this mouse is Large swipes supportive BUT you cannot use it for more than 2 years and you need to buy warranty for it, It does not comes for free.
DO NOT BUY FOR PRO GAMING!",0,Negative

Carrie,5,01/20/2021,Black - Arctis 5,"Great buy, solid headset","Got these in yesterday. This is our second set, not because they broke but because our new kitten chewed the chord. Had the first set almost a year and my daughter games daily. So far this has been her favorite brand, and we have been through loads!
Sound quality is amazing, after talking with her friends, they said the quality of the microphone was spot on. I think the only thing that would make her happier is if I had managed a wireless version. As far as durability, my daughter is 16 and frequently plays horror games. It has held up to the screaming although I can’t say the same for my ears. She is home schooled so used it with her computer as well for videos and chat and has no issues with it.
I would recommend this product if you need a good solid headset that doesn’t cost an insane amount of money.",0,Positive
Debbie Currin,1,11/08/2023,10ft - Black,Kinks up Really bad!!!,Had it a few months. It's kinked up so bad I can hardly plug it in. Very disappointing coming from this brand! Looking into another brand now.,1,Negative
sam,5,11/03/2023,Mercury White,Great for office work too!,"I've had this mouse for almost a year now and love it! I work from home and needed a better mouse than what the company gave me and this did not disappoint. The best feature are the two buttons on the side for your thumb though. Once you get the hang of it you'll never want a ""normal"" mouse again. My only complaint is that the left index finger button is beginning to stick a little. Besides that -great mouse!",0,Positive
Brian Hicks,2,02/15/2024,Classic Black,Left click issues (avoid till quality improves),"Razer DeathAdder Essential Review -
I previously had a Deathadder for a few years and replaced it in December when the left click became intermediate. I purchased this one as a follow up because the previous had lasted around 5 years or so but I'm already have issues with the left mouse click randomly double clicking when trying to use it. Google searches reveal a widespread issue so I'm moving away from this mouse.

A side note, you can blow into the area of the left click and the issue will go away for just bit.",0,Negative

GamePlayer,5,25/12/2023,10ft - Black,long Lightning cable. Work fine.,"Just do not bend them at the ends and treat the ends with care. Like all lightnign cables, they seem to break or stop working if the ends are ""flexed"" or twisted to any degree.

Tiffany,1,11/10/2023,Mercury White,PLEASE READ BEFORE BUYING!!! VIRUS,"Please, for the love of god, DO NOT buy this product. There are Chinese characters on the box indicating that this is obviously not a real Razer mouse. IT IS A SCAM. Upon plugging the device, you will be prompted to download two software programs to customize and calibrate your mouse. This is where the virus happens. It PERMANENTLY disabled my Ethernet. I did not have access to my internet anymore. I uninstalled the software programs and it temporarily fixed it. It occurred again even without the software programs installed a day later. DO NOT BUY!!! Save yourself the pain of having to buy a new internet adapter or hard drive.. I can't stress this enough, just get items like these from Best Buy or the official website. The cheapness of the product will not be worth it. Please boost this and save other people from getting a virus too!",0,Negative
Andrew,3,03/25/2023,Classic Black,Scroll Wheel Broken After a Few Months,"Overall I loved this mouse. It feels so good ergonomically and the responsiveness is excellent. But I ordered it back in October 2022 (It is now March 2023) and I have to buy a new mouse now because the scroll wheel is going crazy on me. Every time I try to scroll one way it scrolls the other, and then it doesn't and then it does, it confuses me. So in all, great mouse for the time that it lasted which wasn't as long as I would have hoped.",0,Positive

stillo,4,03/29/2023,Mercury White,"Comfy mouse, but scroll press is weird","I don’t mind this mouse, I had a razor one before and it hasn’t done me wrong. The only complaint I have is that when I use scroll up and down (I use a lot in gaming) it mistakes it as scroll press way too easily, my old mouse wasn’t like that. If I scroll up just a little too much it will activate the scroll press in my games (which is usually ping) and it’s annoying. Other than that the mouse is pretty looking",1,Positive
rainydays,5,01/06/2024,Classic Black,good mouse,it's a nice mouse but the clicks might be too loud. It's quite clicky. The software works and you can customize lighting. It kind of improved my fps gaming skills in some way idk. The bad thing about it is just it's just a bit loud.,0,Positive
Hunter,4,09/25/2023,Black - Nova 3,Good quality but some minor issues,This is a great headset and I've loved the features that come with them. Only issue with them is the USB C cable that plugs into the headset sometimes unplugs while I'm using them which is a bit annoying but tolerable.,0,Positive

It's great in the hand and has good drivers. The main issue I've had with it is the scroll wheel. It starts to get a bit jumpy after a month or two. Say you were to scroll down, it would scroll up and then back down. The only way I found to fix it for around 10 minutes was to blow into the scroll wheel. Great mouse for gaming, not as durable as I had hoped.",0,Negative

C.,1,09/26/2023,Classic Black,BEWARE OF BOOTLEGS,"*EDIT* The product I received was a bootleg. Looks nearly identical since it has the same body. The review remains 1 star because Amazon allows sellers to hijack popular listings by undercutting, then selling fake products. Razer is also to blame for selling their rejected mouse bodies to third parties. This review was written under the assumption that what I got was a real razer product that had gone down in quality.

THIS REVIEW IS FOR PEOPLE WHO EXPECT THE SAME QUALITY AS THEIR OLD ESSENTIAL ADDER
My old adder is (model no. : RZ01-0385) (product no. : RZ01-03850100) Made in THAILAND

on this listing it states to be (item model number : RZ01-03850100-R3U1)

what i received is (model no. : RZ01-0254) (product no. : RZ01-02540100) Made in CHINA

---

Bought one of these from game stop a couple years ago. Has worked great, and still does. But I wanted to get a new one since the scroll wheel has started to act funky after all the abuse (spamming bhops)

I noticed a few issues right away. The left and right clicks were both way stiffer than on my old one, and the right click seemed to be slightly stiffer than the left.
Second issue I noticed was that it does not glide smoothly at all. 1 glide foot is uneven making its corner dig into the mouse pad. I can literally hear it. it sounds like if you drag your finger nail on the pad. This also affects aiming.
Third issue is the thumb buttons. my old one has buttons that click like the 2 main buttons. the new one has buttons that make a hollow/cheap sound.
Fourth issue, It feels lighter. this wouldn't be a problem, but im looking for the same mouse ive grown accustomed to. I don't want to have to relearn muscle memory.

Issues 1 and 2 may fade with time as the mouse is broken in, but im not going to bother finding out. Its not the model advertised so im returning it.",0,Negative
Coureton Dalton,4,10/12/2021,Black - Arctis 5,"Solid and effective, with one caveat.","A solid and well designed headset, the Arctis 5 does everything I want, the only downside as other reviews have noted is the proprietary connectors. This is well constructed and comfortable, even for someone with a larger head like me. The head elastic helps a lot, as do the ear cups. I was dubious about the retractable microphone, but since this is a headset I bring back and forth to work, it is actually a really nice feature.

The volume adjust on the headset with the chat/game balance knob takes some getting used to, but is definitely not a bad feature. This headset is intended for people doing gaming rather than my primary purpose which is work, but it works very well in my role as a remote IT helpdesk manager/dispatcher. I will try to remember to update on longevity since the reason I got it is due to other headsets breaking in a couple months.",0,Positive

Now, November 26, the same year and it stopped working altogether. So I guess if you want the hassle of buying one that works like it should, then you’d need to replace this one every 2 months. Don’t waste your money.",1,Negative
Damaris L,5,12/06/2019,Black - Arctis 5,Love Them!,"This headset is so comfortable that you end up forgetting you have them on.

My old pair was great but started peeling around the headband and the ears, I’d always end up with the peelings around my ears and neck. These Steelseries though have a different headband that I know won’t peel! And if the band gets sweaty or starts to smell for whatever reason, I can simply wash it!

The audio is great! In video games the quality is crisp and the noise cancellation DEFINITELY works. You can always adjust the settings and customize the light that outline the ear piece.

I love that the mic lights up red when I mute and how it retracts or goes back inside when I’m not using it.

All in all I am so happy with my headset!",0,Positive

Kevin Teeple,4,02/17/2019,Black - Arctis 5,Better than the Arctis 3,"For reasons beyond me, one day when I woke up, the back sound and microphone jacks on my computer stopped working. After simple troubleshooting showed me it wasn't a software issue, I was faced with possibly taking the computer to an expensive repair shop. But then I recalled that I read the SteelSeries Arctis 5 actually comes with a USB connection. I already had the SteelSeries Arctis 3. When the Arctis 5 arrived, I was pleasantly surprised. It works perfectly with my USB, it's comfortable, and the sound and microphone quality is good.
A few minor quibbles:
It comes with a separate knob supposedly to easily change the mix between in-game sound effects and the sound of fellow plays' audio, but the tiny pamphlet of instructions on it was unclear, so all I use it for is an indication of whether it's plugged in.
Also, it contains lights in the sides of the headphones, which is a really dumb place to have lights. It doesn't harm anything, but they serve absolutely no purpose whatsoever.",0,Positive
goldskull08,5,10/20/2021,Black - Arctis 5,Amazing Headset!,This headset is one of the best that I have ever bought in my many years of gaming. The design itself with the elastic strap is extremely comfortable for any head shape so anyone that comes over can enjoy these! The ability to change the amount of game vs chat volume is also something I never thought I would use but it is surprisingly cool especially when using apps like Discord. I would highly recommend these headphones to anyone looking for great quality for a rather reasonable price!!!,0,Positive
Jonathan,2,19/12/2021,10ft - Black,It kinda gets loose in the phone after about a month,It got a loose connection after the first month of use and doesn't like to charge at certain angles. I've only used the cable after my phone has died and it doesn't work the same as when I first bought,1,Negative
Tyler Moore,5,07/10/2023,Black - Nova 3,Great multi-platform headset,"I bought this since my old steelseries mic started making a static noise in the game. This time I went with wired since I didn’t like having to charge the old one. Sound quality is great happy it comes with different cables. I use the usb c to 3.5 cable on my switch and usb c to usb c on my PS5. RGB is cool if your into it, I don’t think you can control the colors with consoles only pc so it’s default is rainbow color cycle. Overall happy and it was an Amazon deal price so saved 20 bucks.",0,Positive
Junk Logins,4,02/08/2020,Black - Arctis 5,Fine headphones with one issue,"Headphones work fine, microphone is a little finicky to get situated to pick up voice without sound of breathing, but that might just be a personal issue as adjust a microphone leaves me winded.

Biggest problem (apparently pretty common with Arctis headphones) is that this headset includes a volume control knob designed to allow you to change the relative volume of 'chat' and 'game' channels. This is a neat feature in theory but suffers from a couple of issues:

A) The knob to adjust the volume is extremely easily turned, which means that if you don't put it somewhere nothing will touch it, you're likely to have one of the channels muted or rapidly changing volume before long
and
B) There's no version of the adapter to allow you to use the headphones with the microphone unless you have the knob attached, or a switch to lock/disable the knob. The output from the headphones is a special port that connects to the knob which outputs as a normal USB. You can also use a normal 3.5mm jack, but as the manufacturer notes, to do so is to lose out on the surround sound capability and other features.

All-in-all they're fine headphones, but if you're on the fence you should be aware that you will end up with an extra permanent feature on your desk that you have to keep isolated from any contact, which makes it a little hard to recommend them.",0,Positive
Jason Saar,5,09/26/2023,Black - Nova 3,Girlfriend loved them,"I bought these as a gift for my girlfriend, and the sound quality is much better with these compared to another brand that cost twice as much. Highly recommend Steelseries, and these are a great value.",0,Positive

I needed something better that worked...all the time.  This cable does just that...it works all the time.  Maybe it is designed for ""fast charging"" where my other cables were not.  However, the bottom line is this is a great cable.I always had problems with straight in charging cables.  It could be that twisting and turning the cable might have damaged it.  However this cable is not a ""straight in"" cable. it has a right angle. Also, the connection appears to be very well built an durable.I highly recommend this cable.

Do you wonder why? Well, it's the scroll wheel. After a while the wheel will start to malfunction and jump forward and backward somewhat randomly. Nothing seems to fix it for long. Yeah, the other features work fine, but personally I use the wheel a lot. It gets old fast when it's not right. Never seen this problem before, but in retrospect it's sad to see a optical mouse last a shorter duration than a old mechanical ball mouse.",0,Negative

Clint H.,4,01/01/2024,Classic Black,Awesome and Affordable - Razer DeathAdder Essential Gaming Mouse Review,"I just got the Razer DeathAdder Essential Gaming Mouse, and I really like it for my gaming setup.

First off, it feels good in my hand. The design is simple but comfy, and the textured grips on the sides keep it from slipping during long gaming sessions. It's not too fancy, but it works well.

When it comes to gaming, this mouse is top-notch. It responds super quickly and accurately, making my game moves smooth. I can also change the sensitivity settings to fit how I like to play different games.

The mouse is tough and well-made. It feels strong, and the buttons click nicely, adding to the gaming experience. What's cool is that it doesn't cost a lot, making it perfect for gamers who want quality without spending too much.

Sure, it doesn't have all the fancy lights like some other mice, but for the price and how well it works, I'm okay with that. It's a solid choice for gamers on a budget who still want a good gaming mouse.

In a nutshell, the Razer DeathAdder Essential Gaming Mouse is awesome and won't hurt your wallet. It's comfy, works great for gaming, and is a smart pick if you're looking for quality without breaking the bank. I totally recommend it!",0,Positive

Trevor Lea,5,05/23/2020,White - Arctis 5,"Comfortable, feature rich, and they sound excellent.","I love this headset. The positives, the speaker and mic audio quality are top notch, has a mute button and volume on the headset, retractable mic, a volume balance knob for chat and game (if using Discord or a similar app), LED lighting, and they are super comfortable. The only negative is after wearing them for hours the can cause perspiration around the ears. However, this isn't unusual for a gaming headset. The headset also comes with an adapter so it can also be used with a standard 3.5mm audio/mic jack like on a phone.

Once of the coolest features of this headset is the chat / game balance control. This was I can easily adjust the volume of my teammates versus the in game narration, sound effects, or whatever. Very helpful when playing an RPG like FO76 and you want to hear the characters over other folks in the Discord channel.

Finally, the software is stable and integrates other SteelSeries products together, like my MSI laptop keyboard. No complaints.",0,Positive

Smith,5,05/16/2023,Classic Black,Smooth as butter.,Nice Teflon pads on the bottom. Slides nice on a mouse pad. Such a nice size for my large hands I didn’t even feel the size difference from my old one. Sometimes a new mouse feels too odd for a few days and you never really like it. Something rubs on your hand or finger and gets annoying. Not this one. It feels great in my hand. Only thing I did not like is the fact when I added it to my computer it started to load software. How did it do this? Is there files on the mouse in some sort of memory that ran when I plugged it in? This was razor unique software and not windows it tried to load. Sure it’s convenient but what if it auto loaded spyware or a virus? I don’t like how it forced its software on me. I stopped the download and deleted the software. Buyer beware I guess.,0,Positive

But it broke after 1 month of use, the scroll wheel would teleport around when I used it, at first it was annoying but then it got frustrating especially with shooters, or playing a sniper.

Brittney Sosa,1,08/19/2023,Mercury White,Terrible quality. Second mouse broke at 4 months of useage.,"This is the second purchase I've made of the same brand and model. I had to replace the first one after owning it for a year because when I would scroll, the page would skip upwards and downwards a bit. I took it apart, took a can of air to it to blow off any dust, and put it back together. Still having the skipping issue. I figured it was just an issue with this particular mouse and bought a new one. It hasn't been 4 months since I've owned it and I'm having the skipping issue AGAIN. To be clear, I don't live in a dusty environment or with pets. I can't figure out a discernable reason for this to continue happening. I do have another Razer mouse (it's about 6 years old) on my work computer and it is still going strong with zero issues. I suppose it's only this newer model that's having issues. Until Razer addresses and fixes this model, I highly suggest for you to use another brand.",0,Negative

These sound a little bit more hollow, but may be because my old headphones fit tighter over the ears. Steelseries software that comes with the headphones fixes everything though.

Mic is really good. My teammates can hear everything clearly and it does a good job of not picking up clicks and pops.

Fit is finicky. Took some adjusting of the ski strap to make it fit well. I also had to get used to the fit because they hurt my ears, got over it in less than a week.

Chatmix cable works really well for what it's meant to. But I don't find myself using it very much. As far as I know, it only works with Discord, so in game chat is read as game audio.",0,Positive

He also mentioned that it has a software that helps to customize sound experience and has a few presets for the games he likes to play (like VALORANT). He can lower sounds that he doesn't want to hear and elevate footstep sounds. He also likes that it has a really long wire so he can walk around to get things while playing. From what I've heard, it doesn't really help with noise canceling but he wasn't looking for noise canceling so it worked out.

James Woods,4,12/01/2019,White - Arctis 5,Ringing in left ear when mic is being used.,"This headset is great. They are super comfortable, the audio quality is great, and the mic quality is as one would expect. The steelseries app, for RGB and other sound customization is very easy to use as well. The ""Chat/Game mixer"" Is my favorite thing about this headset by far. Easily letting you change chat/game volume to favor one or the other, without alt-tabbing or going into options.

**My only issue is that whenever an app is utilizing the mic (Discord, Skype, recording software, etc.) there is a very high pitched, noticeable ringing in the left ear. Seeing how this is the same side that the wire plugs into I am led to believe that this is just some sort of feedback issue. As of recently I have started recording/streaming, so this I am using the mic more often, therefore noticing this more often.

If you do not plan to stream alot, or use the mic an excessive amount then I would very much so recommend this headset. I personally am going to exchange mine for the wireless option to eliminate this issue.",0,Positive

Nga Nguyen,2,07/07/2022,Classic Black,"Disappointing, there are better mice.","Very disappointed, the cable is quite short compared to most other mice on the market, this wasn't a problem for me since my pc was close by but it is noticeably shorter so it might be for others. For some reason the cable is also a rubber one instead of braided. Even for 18 dollars I would invest a couple more bucks into some other options. It is a heavier mouse, I understand its a bigger mouse but there are other options that are similar in size and much much lighter. If you are used to a light mouse don't switch to this one. Another thing is that you have to have the Razer Synapse software in order to adjust the dpi so you can't just plug it in and game. Your sensitivity will be completely off, for me it was defaulted at 1600 dpi which quadrupled my sensitivity. However the worst thing about this mouse is probably the lift off distance. The lift off distance is extremely high where as even in other ""budget"" mice the lift off is much much shorter. This means that you have to lift the mouse quite high in order to adjust or else the sensor will still track. This is a huge issue in video games especially FPS when you are aiming. Some pros however are that the shape and buttons are fine. The side buttons have little pre travel which is a common issue in many mice.",0,Negative

I purchased this cable a year ago and it already has enough wear on it to where it's no longer charging properly, in fact some devices won't charge at all. The cable now has to be plugged in on specific sides instead of either side, which defeats the whole purpose of the USB-C's design and a certain end needs to be plugged into the phone and the cable itself has to be angled perfectly in order to charge. While I recommend this for the length I do not recommend it for heavy use, if you're willing to sacrifice length for durability I highly recommend Anker's powerline series of C cables as I've bought my powerline cable 2 years ago and it's still working perfectly.TL;DR This cable is not durable enough for heavy use, the Anker Powerline cables are.",1,Negative

It appears to me that Anker may have changed the exterior of this cable at some point which may contribute to the odor. Whatever the case it’s intolerable at this moment.Update: the odor hasn’t dissipated at all - in fact the area of the house I placed it to air out now also smells terrible when I opened the door! It’s getting returned. I would caution anyone that is sensitive/allergic to avoid this product!

Bolokai,5,07/12/2022,Mercury White,Let me tell you why the other reviews on here are WRONG,"1. This mouse is not ""lightweight junk"".
2. Braided cables are worse.
3. Silicone side grips were never that great.

Some of the reviews on here are ridiculous. Let me clear some things up.

The Kailh switches in here are mid-weight and feel slightly heavier (and less mushy) than the optical switches in the Deathadder V2. The side buttons feel significantly better than the V2. The scroll wheel is less tactile (or smoother, depending on how you look at it).

This is a heavy, heavy boy by today's standards. This thing is better built than the V2, but consequently harder to do a weight reduction mod because the plastic is so damn thick.

People that complain about this version not having a braided cable... you want an even less flexible one?! Razer's braided cable is the same rubber cable with an additional outside sheath, making it even less flexible. This cable is an improvement from years past, but it's not great. Fortunately because it's not braided, it's easy to rip the rubber sheath and shielding off, and paracord it.

The side grips are meh. It's a bit more than molded plastic, but not as noticeable as the silicone on the V2. Silicone still gets slippery when wet, so best solution was always aftermarket grips. If the V2 had G703 quality rubber grips to being with, then I could see the grip complaints on here being justified.

My biggest problem with this thing is the lack of replacement skates. No corepads or tiger ice for this model. It has the rear skate of the V2, but two front skates more similar to the V2 Pro. If you you like the white color or mechanical switches, and use less than 6400dpi, then can't go wrong for $20 and some elbow grease.

Software still blows. Can use open source software to permaset light effects when not plugged into PC w/ Synapse.",0,Positive

Pascal,4,09/22/2022,Classic Black,Item not the same as the old one with same model from official website,"I'm not able to verify if it's new model or not authentic. Since the wire is rubber wrap not nylon(I've also attached the picture of my current mouse brought 1year ago with same model). And small details are different.
Also, they are different weights.
The Deathadder essential brought from rayzer website is 123g currently
The Deathadder essential brought from here weight is 128g.
Amazing! I wear and tear 5g of material from the old mouse after 1 year!

Zarian S,2,06/15/2023,Mercury White,"Nice to use, but shoddy quality","I personally love the way this mouse feels to use, but the price very much reflects the quality of the mouse itself because the scroll wheel stopped working properly within 2 weeks of owning it and within a month and a half it's begun to double-click. An unfortunate shame. Maybe it's a matter of ""You get what you pay for""? Either way, I'd probably try to find a mouse with better build quality next time.

Update August 10th, 2023: The scroll wheel full-on broke. I've never had a mouse last me such a small amount of time. Downgrading a star because I had to replace with a different brand. You truly do get what you pay for I guess.",0,Negative
David Sherwood,2,10/06/2022,Classic Black,Declining Quality Control,"I take no joy in writing this review, given the deathadder is essentially the only mouse I've used for the past decade, but the quality control has gotten so awful it warrants being called out. Over those ten years, I've gone through roughly 5 deathadders, with each having a shorter lifespan than the last.

The biggest thing to call out is the scroll wheel. Both the click and the spin itself are notoriously faulty - the latest deathadder I purchased has a botched scroll wheel after just a few months of use. Scrolling is completely erratic even with careful movements, and the mouse prior stopped registering scroll wheel/MB3 clicks.

IMO this mouse was the best bang for your buck for the majority of the 2010s, but its best days are long gone.",0,Negative

Shadowbuys,4,05/28/2021,Black - Arctis 5,"It's a good headset for the price, I just have a few nit picks","This product is pretty good and seems to be worth it so far, there is a few small nit picks I have:
While the ski strap style band on it is pretty comfortable, it isn't very adjustable
the volume dial on the headset is very easy to accidentally bump
while the material that the muffs are made out of feel really good and don't make your ears sweaty, the actual cloth that they're made out of, while breathable, isn't the most comfortable to me personally.
Conclusion: While I'm no audiophile, this headset sounds good and the mic also sounds better than most I've had. It is a good step up from the the cheap ~$20-30 dollar rgb trash no name ""gaming headsets"" that are avalible on amazon while still not breaking the bank (to much) and it was worth the upgrade.",0,Positive
Rocky,4,07/04/2023,Classic Black,Decent but scroll wheel issues,Decent mouse. The main issue is that the scroll wheel doesn't always respond the way it should. Sometimes it will scroll down when trying to scroll up. Very aggravating. After researching the issue on the Internet I have found that if you blow into the side of the scroll wheel it usually fixes the issue for a while. Not something you should have to do for a manufacturer of this 'caliber'.,0,Negative
Andrea Phillips,3,12/19/2022,Classic Black,"Great mouse, with terrible software",This mouse would be perfect if it didn't require you to use Razer's idiotic software to configure it.

Kev,1,11/07/2023,Classic Black,"Scroll Wheel Issues, Rename to Deadhelm.","All joking aside, The mouse isn't particularly special, it does the job for gaming/work, it has a decent weight and shape, and the two extra programable buttons don't feel awkward or hard to press. I bought this mouse 9 months ago, (with 5 or so days extra) and the scroll wheel is already causing me issues scrolling up and down, its a heavy annoyance. It seems to be a pattern now that I'm back to see the reviews.

To be fair, I haven't found a razer mouse under $100 that lasts longer than 10 months without a scroll wheel or double/triple clicking problems. Maybe their quality sub-100 is just designed to fail before a year, but I haven't bought anything pricy enough to compare. Don't expect this mouse to last longer than a year without a miracle if you use for gaming a lot.

**NOTE**: Y'all save your money, this one in particular isn't worth it. I bought another one to confirm the longetivity just in case there might've been a defect or I treated it poorly, but the new one that arrived as of today (11/8) has a stiff scroll wheel that does not work half the time. Seriously disappointed.",0,Negative

And yes, I've tried every software fix I could to see if it might be a software issue, but nothing has fixed it so I can only blame the mouse at this point. The first razer product I've had issues with.",0,Negative
Vinay K,5,22/02/2024,10ft - Black,Great companion to the 120W charger,The advertised 65W PD charger of a power adapter didn't work on a recent flight to charge my MacBook.

Edwin Davy,1,21/06/2023,10ft - Black,My cable only passes 5W of power,Bought this cable to charge my Asus Ally via a battery pack. Paired it with the Anker 737 as I wanted 100W of power in order to run the Ally through a dock at max power. I then bought the Anker GaNPrime wall adapter that outputs 120W of power. When I use this cable into the power block to charge it from the wall adapter I only get 5W however when I use the cable that came with the 737 power bank I get 92W. Through this deduction I can confidently say that either A. I got a defective cable or B. This cable is not rated for what is being advertised. Returning and buying a different cable.,1,Negative

Cloth earpieces, not my first choice, but, these were fairly comfortable, at first.
i prefer a bigger ear piece, one that doesnt press against my hear , but covers it entirely.
a bit too tight on my head as well, after a short while, it was getting uncomfortable.

mic quality is good, as these are one of the better wired headsets out there.

but, i couldnt keep them as the comfort factor on them was bordering on painful after about an hour of gaming.
sound is really excellent. very crisp, and i have tinnitus bad ( ringing in the ears ). had they had a better ear piece design, i would absolutely have kept them.

SO.. if they fit you or you dont mind a bit of a more secure fit, these will do you well. one of the best sounding of the 4 headsets i bought to try out.

On the 9th, the right click started acting funky. I restarted my PC and unplugged and replugged it in, and it fixed. However, I believe this was coincidental. On the 10th, the right click started acting HORRENDOUS. As in, triple clicking, clicking when not pressing, dropping clicks entirely... Restarting and replugging it did not change a thing. Tested on another PC, same issue. Swapped out cable extenders, same issue. Attempted plugging it directly into the PC, as inconvenient as that would be in my setup... still the issue. Multiple ports, no help.

I firmly believe stuff happens. Quality control is not, and never will be perfect. I ended up reordering this mouse off Wal-Mart to see. So far it is working flawless. The mouse is incredible, I think I got unlucky here... again. I also ordered an EVGA X20 off Amazon. Hope it goes better, too. I still think overall I would recommend this product, as it wouldn't have such a high rating so consistently if this happened incredibly often. I will dock a few starts, but I honestly still think the mouse it good.

Original post -
I first ordered a Redragon M910K, and it was faulty. I decided to put 10 extra dollars in and order this mouse instead.

Take note this is a day one review and if I have problems, I will update. Assume this is all still relevant if you see this review after a couple months and I haven't edited it.

First Impressions
-Glide is good. Feels very smooth.
-Cable pulls the mouse slightly due to the smooth glide. However, not much, and if your cable is tied forward, or simply going straight, you won't notice it. Just don't have your cable go off at an angle immediately and you need not to worry.
-Feels very... non-durable? I wouldn't slam it. If you aren't a heavy rager, it should be fine. Hit your keyboard instead. NOT CHEAP FEELING THOUGH. Feels perfectly fine for this price!
-Simple look. Black with Green LED's. Perfect printing on the logo.
-Side buttons are a bit high for me, if your thumb rests low like mine, you may have a hard time reaching them. That's why the ""Ergonomic"" is a 4 star, but only from a personal stance not an overall stance.
-Very Comfortable. Enough said

Overall, I am very happy with this, and if this review is un-updated, I still am. Just waiting for the software to install to change my DPI currently. If you are looking for a good mouse below $30, this is a good mouse. A very good mouse.

Would I recommend it at this price range? Yes.

Best regards from a fat idiot",0,Negative
Mike Eckman,5,02/07/2024,Classic Black,Great Mouse for Basic Use,"I disagree that this mouse is considered a gaming mouse. Other than the fancy logo and color changing LEDs, there is not much about this mouse that caters it for gaming. I use gaming mice and prefer ones with more than just two side buttons, and a much heavier weight. This is a lightweight mouse which is fine for office work where you're in front of a computer 8 hours a day, but I would much prefer something different for gaming.

But as a general use office mouse, it works great. It is ergonomic enough to be used right or left handed, the scroll wheel works fine, and the buttons press with a reassuring CLICK. For the price, use this in your office, but if you want to get into a Call of Duty or Fortnight tournament, definitely get something else.",0,Positive
Vance,5,11/29/2023,Mercury White,Perfect mouse,"Recently got my hands on this sleek white mouse for my setup, and it's quickly become a standout addition. Visually, it seamlessly fits into my all-white gear, bringing an upgraded aesthetic.

Functionality-wise, it's a game-changer. The clicks are perfectly balanced—neither too loud nor too soft. What sets it apart, though, is the ergonomic design. It feels tailor-made for my hand, ensuring a comfortable experience even during extended work sessions. No more hand strain or awkward grips.

The mouse's movements are impressively smooth, offering precise control like a well-choreographed dance across the screen. It's more than just a tool; it's a functional and stylish companion to my daily tasks.

If you're in the market for a mouse that not only complements your setup visually but also excels in performance and comfort, this one's a solid choice. My workspace has levelled up, and the daily grind feels a whole lot better with this reliable companion. 👍",0,Positive

Clay Walkup,3,09/23/2023,Classic Black,Possibly Fake Mouse,"The mouse is functional, it does what a mouse is supposed to do I guess, but I do believe it’s a “fake” manufactured mouse. Maybe it’s just the one I received, idk but it isn’t the actual DeathAdder Essential produced by Razor. It does not connect to Razer’s Synapse program, is not detectable at all, and I tried downloading updated drivers for it, but it does not register as the DeathAdder at all. When viewed in the setting as devices, it registers as “Gaming Mouse” where as typical Razer Peoducts are detected as their actual model name. This may not be a big deal to everyone, as I as I said it does technically work, but the idea of the item being sold as a fake, and being up charged to its amount is bad business. I tried to register the warranty as well, and it had already been registered, so this is possibly a refurbished unit, which is why it’s not being detected? Idk, either way it’s wrong, and not what it is advertised as, however I gotta give it 3 stars because it does function.",0,Negative

For the price, I consider this a great value!Ultimately failed near one of the plugs, becoming very sensitive to orientation/pressure and intermittently disconnecting.

Ian,4,06/22/2023,Mercury White,"Overall pretty good, except the scroll wheel.","Like many other reviews, there seems to be a probably with the scroll wheel. After about 2 weeks of use the scroll wheel went up even after scrolling down. This is a major problem for me, but it might not be for others. When I play games (mainly shooters) I use the scroll wheel to switch between weapons. When I'm out of ammo and I switch my gun it'll just end up switching to secondary then back to the main weapon, which has no ammo in it which to no surprise ends up getting me killed. Other than that excellent mouse, it's lightweight and feels good in the hand. Would recommend that you use the scroll wheel sparingly.",0,Positive

nobody,5,10/22/2021,White - Arctis 5,"Super comfortable, great sound quality, relatively easy to set up.","I'm so glad I decided to just shell out the extra money for a good headset. Steelseries engine has preset equalizers. one is Flat, one is Voice, they sound like shit, as expected. but man, when you set the equalizer to Music? shiiiiiiiiiiit. these things sound incredible when you have some spotify blasting. just out of the box they sound good. but downloading the engine and trying different presets is nice.

they're also super comfortable. the velcro makes it weird trying to find the right fit but it only takes 2 minutes of fidgeting around to find it. if that. the earpads are crazy soft and squishy, they feel great. I wear glasses too. no problem. they might feel weird at first, you just have to find the right fit with the velcro. they sit on your head and around your ears so seamlessly.

the mic is basically what you would expect from a headset. it doesn't sound incredible but it's good for what you pay for. it's better than most i've heard.

has a volume scroll wheel on the left ear to raise or lower your volume. very nice.

its great, buy it.",0,Positive

Sophie,4,03/18/2022,Black - Arctis 5,Great Headset - Not As Good Mic for Feminine Voices,"This headset is pretty good. The dial is great, and after using a USB headset I don't think I can ever go back to using a jack headset. The RGB lights are fun and the customizability in the Steelseries program is pretty nice. I've only had two notable issues:

1) The left earpiece has a tendency to be quieter. Can't tell if this is a me issue with my own ear or a headset issue, but you can manually balance the speaker levels in your native sound systems so it's not that big of an issue.
2) The mic is great... For lower voices. I have a higher voice, and since this lacks some of the decibel levels in the high range, it's much more tinny for my voice. If you have a deeper voice this'll probably be better for you. Mic is still good quality, just sounds tinny.

Overall, I like it! Good and fun headset, get it on sale if you can.",0,Positive

It happens in 3-5 second intervals. This is especially annoying if my computer is almost dead. My trust of Anker products so steadily declining.

CyberSensei🥋,4,09/03/2024,10ft - Silver,⚡️ The Ultimate Charge: Anker's 100W Nylon USB-C Cable Unleashed 🌟🌟🌟🌟,"In the fast-paced world of technology, staying powered up and ready to go is more than a convenience—it's a necessity. With devices becoming increasingly powerful and energy-hungry, the quest for the perfect charging solution becomes paramount. Enter the realm of high-wattage USB-C cables, a category where the Anker 100W 10ft Nylon USB-C to USB-C 2.0 Cable shines brightly. This cable isn't just another accessory; it's a testament to Anker's commitment to quality, durability, and performance, designed to meet the needs of the most demanding gadgets in your arsenal.As someone who relies heavily on a range of devices for both work and play, finding a charging cable that can keep up with my lifestyle has been a journey filled with trials and errors. The Anker 100W cable, with its promise of fast charging and a robust build, caught my attention as a potential game-changer. From the MacBook Pro to the iPad Pro 2020, and even the Samsung Galaxy S20, this cable promised compatibility and performance across the board. My experience with it has been revealing, showcasing not just the strengths of Anker's design but also highlighting areas where even the best can improve.### Key Highlights:- **Robust Power Delivery**: This cable’s ability to deliver up to 100W of power is nothing short of impressive. It effortlessly charges my MacBook Pro 2020, keeping it powered through the longest of work sessions without breaking a sweat.- **Versatility at Its Core**: The compatibility list of the Anker cable reads like a who’s who of high-end gadgets. From the latest iPad Pro and Air models to top-tier Android devices, this cable has you covered, making it a versatile pick for a tech-savvy user.- 📏 **Extended Reach**: The 10ft length is a game-changer, offering the flexibility to charge devices comfortably, even when the nearest outlet is just out of reach. This extra length means I can use my gadgets in bed or on the sofa without being tethered too close to the wall.- **Durable Design**: Wrapped in a new nylon exterior, the cable not only looks premium but feels built to last. It’s managed to withstand the daily grind of bends and twists without showing signs of wear, a testament to its durability.### Areas for Improvement:- **Stiffness**: While the nylon wrapping adds to the cable’s durability, it also introduces a bit of stiffness. This can make it a tad unwieldy to coil up or manage, especially in tighter spaces or when on the move.- ⚙️ **Connector Size**: The USB-C connectors, while robust, are slightly on the larger side. This isn’t a deal-breaker, but it can be a snug fit in devices with closely spaced ports or when using certain cases.### Summary & Recommendation:The Anker 100W 10ft Nylon USB-C to USB-C Cable earns a well-deserved 4-star rating 🌟🌟🌟🌟. It marries power with versatility, all wrapped up in a durable and stylish design, making it an excellent choice for anyone looking to streamline their charging setup. While it’s not without its quirks, such as the cable’s stiffness and the size of the connectors, these are minor gripes in the grand scheme of things.For tech enthusiasts juggling multiple devices or anyone in need of a reliable, high-powered charging solution, this Anker cable is a compelling choice. It’s a cable that not only meets the demands of today’s power-hungry devices but does so with flair and durability.Thank you for considering this review. Whether you're looking to charge your MacBook, iPad, or any USB-C enabled device, the Anker 100W cable is poised to be a powerful ally in your tech arsenal, making it easier to keep your devices powered and ready to go.",1,Positive

Fernando F.,5,08/02/2024,10ft - Silver,Power Meets Durability: An In-Depth Review of the Anker 100W 10ft Nylon USB-C Charging Cable,"The Anker 100W 10ft New Nylon USB C to USB C 2.0 Type C Charging Cable is a testament to the brand's commitment to quality, durability, and performance. This cable stands out in the crowded market of charging accessories with its impressive features that cater to the needs of modern device users. Here's a comprehensive review of this product:Design and Build Quality: The first thing you'll notice about the Anker cable is its premium build. The new nylon braiding is not only aesthetically pleasing but also significantly enhances the cable's durability. It feels sturdy and is designed to withstand the rigors of daily use without fraying or breaking, a common issue with lesser cables. The 10ft length is another major plus, offering ample flexibility and convenience for charging across longer distances, making it perfect for use in the bedroom, office, or even while lounging on the couch.Charging Performance: Anker doesn't disappoint when it comes to the core function of the cable - charging.

It supports USB-C Power Delivery (PD), making it a versatile option for users with PD-compatible devices seeking quick and efficient charging solutions.Data Transfer: While primarily designed for charging, the cable also supports data transfer with USB 2.0 speeds. This feature is handy for those looking to sync data between devices, though it's worth noting that the speeds aren't the fastest available in the market. However, for regular data transfer needs, it performs reliably and effectively.Compatibility: The Anker 100W cable is compatible with a wide range of USB-C devices, making it a versatile accessory for various gadgets. From laptops like MacBook Pro/Air to smartphones and tablets, this cable ensures you can charge all your devices without needing multiple cables. Its universality is a significant advantage for users who own multiple devices.Value for Money: Considering its durability, performance, and the brand reputation of Anker, this cable offers excellent value for money. It's an investment in quality and convenience, likely to last longer and perform better than cheaper alternatives.Conclusion: The Anker 100W 10ft New Nylon USB C to USB C 2.0 Type C Charging Cable Fast Charge is a top-notch accessory that delivers on every front. Its combination of high-quality materials, fast charging capabilities, and thoughtful design makes it an essential purchase for anyone looking to upgrade their charging setup. Whether you need to charge your devices quickly or are looking for a reliable cable that won't let you down, this Anker cable is sure to meet and exceed your expectations.",1,Positive
Anon,2,07/19/2022,Classic Black,"Affordable and good design, but...","The scroll wheel is already faulty after 6 months. This seems to be a common issue with Razer mice, as I've gone through three of them and none have lasted more than two years (first one also developed clicking issues and the second had all of the plastic on the case gradually peel off). It's apparently not a software issue, and compressed air doesn't help, nor does taking it apart and cleaning it, if you even have the right screwdriver and decide that's worth doing for a cheap mouse. The only positive is you're buying a $20 Razer mouse instead of a $60 Razer mouse that won't even last more than three times as long.",0,Negative

John,4,07/28/2021,Black - Arctis 5,"Fantastic, but lets in a lot of outside noise","These are great headphones. The audio is great, and my buddies say my microphone it a lot better than the earbuds I used to use. Plus the RGB lighting matches my Corsair build, even though you can't really control the headphone color with the Corsair software. I wasn't expecting to, so this is perfectly fine. These headphones have a great minimalistic design that I love.

The pads around the ears and headband are very comfortable and breathable, much better than some other models that don't let your ears breathe and allow things to get humid.

There is a volume knob wired into the cord about halfway between the headset and USB connector. I wish this came with something to stick the knob to my desk or tower. If I move around, sometimes it will fall and the knob will twist after contacting something, either reducing the volume of game chat or the game itself. I wish the knob had a stronger detent in the middle to prevent unintentional adjustments.

Also, when you mute your mic, a red light comes on at the tip of the mic. It is very bright. You can overcome this by retracting the mic into the headset (which is a neat feature) but you can still see the light in your monitor reflection if it is dark in your room. Sort of annoying, but you get used to it.

Lastly, for some strange reason, outside noise seems to be louder when wearing these. I have two mini fridges (beer cooler and wine cooler) in the same room as my PC and I can hear them louder with these on than when I take them off. I really can't explain it - maybe the headphone housing unintentionally amplifies these noises?",0,Positive

Prime 67W, originally I blamed the charger for it, because I tested with all 3 cables from this, and expect correct result.

It's also made charging while using so much easier!The cord has velcro straps to nicely wrap up any excess cord, if needed. I find that very useful for my needs.It charges much faster than the 1 foot cord that came with the phone, so I'm quite pleased.

Mr. Sir,1,07/21/2023,Classic Black,Scroller jumps around madly after owning it for 1 year,"Getting customer support for the above issues is annoying as they run you through a whole checklist of things you need to do before they'll help you. After checking all those things off on the website, it promptly refuses to load Customer Support contact info. (edit: I tried again on another day and the website was fixed. The firmware still doesn't work) The firmware updater, Razer Synapse 3.0, refuses to detect this mouse and update it. Downloading the firmware from the official site and trying to apply it directly has the same result. In short, they are not supporting this product at all. Do not buy.

Edit #2 I am now approaching my third run through of customer support. It has been a literally month since I first started trying to get this mouse refunded. Every step has been littered with inconveniences seemingly designed to make the customer give up on getting a refund, and go away.

They have asked me for the same serial number three times, along with all the other info about the issue, the invoice; everything. They've also made me fill out a promise - the same promise I filled out the last two times - that I have tried a shit ton of unrelated things to make the mouse work again. Now, for the third time, after waiting weeks for a resolution, they have decided to restart the whole process and ask me from verification of my address in the form of bills, utilities, etc. I'm moving, so I can't give that. Here's the kicker - they are asking for the rest of the information too. This company is atrocious.",0,Negative

taylor dginto,5,07/28/2019,Black - Arctis 5,Great price for fantastic headset,"Now I'm sure there is someone more suited to write a tech reveiw but I really love this headset. For the price this is the most comfortable headset I've ever put on. I'm 4' 11"" so as you can imagine I have a hard time finding things that are of good quality AND don't make me look like a child playing dress up. The slim form not only looks good but still sounds amazing. The cherry on top here is the headset also doesn't look like it was made for a child. When my fiance wears them they look just as good on him (if not better.)

I don't play too many games with directional sound but my fiance has told me they are as good as his Razor headset (not sure of the model but identical to the white ones worn by Pewdiepie). I do however listen to a lot of music and play a few games and the immersion is always amazing. The adjustable audio app is really cool as well though I haven't explored it fully yet.

All in all I love this headset and would recommend it to anyone.

The shape seems to be identical to the one I had (the reason I wanted another one), but the only complaint I have is that the Elite I had had a rubberized pad on either side that made it a bit ""sticky"" to your fingers so you could pick it up and reposition it easier on the mouse pad. This mouse does not have have those rubberized pads, so I have had it slip out of my hand when trying to grip it to reposition. So far, though, that is the only complaint I have with the mouse.

A m a Z O n F r e a K,4,06/07/2023,Black - Arctis 5,"Good, software troublesome","OK, here we go!

Pros:
Great Fit
Sound is good
Just plugs right in with ease

Cons:
Software is not good. Too many choices, which in turn makes your game sound like crap.

Overall:
Great headset, but out of the box and plugging in is a nightmare. I had one of my gamers get the same headset and he also said the software is quite cumbersome to the point of uninstalling it. Basically in a nutshell, I plugged the headset it and navigated to the windows settings to adjust ambient sounds, etc., done, works as expected after that change.

Good luck getting these to work unless your a rocket scientist and can sit in front of the software for hours, purely ridiculous whomever developed this sorry excuse for sound control.

Have fun!",0,Positive

S. Swanner,4,06/16/2022,Black - Arctis 5,A very solid headset with some quirks,"I've owned this headset for several years now. It's been a pretty consistent experience.

Pros: Quality sound and a decent amount of customization with the application.
Breakaway cable able to be switched with a normal headphone cable
Volume and mic mute adjustment easy to find and use
Mic quality is pretty good, all things considered.

Cons: Breakaway cable connecting the headset to inline USB chat dongle is prone to twisting, which for me resulted in eventually having to replace it due to damage caused by this phenomenon. This is fixed by unplugging it from either end and allowing it to unwind.
Maybe not quite as loud as I would like, but this could be preference.
Only minor adjustment to the fit with the strap provided.

Ultimately, I would recommend this headset if you're a fan of the Steelseries ecosystem. I would maybe opt for a wireless model, but this one isn't bad if that isn't your preference.",0,Positive

Alexandra W,5,03/31/2022,White - Arctis 5,3 Cheers for SteelSeries,"This gaming headset is everything for me! I use it exclusively for PC gaming and love the dial that lets me change sound focus from browser/game to voice chat. It's really helpful during gaming moments where I don't have time to manually go into the game settings and lower the sound so I can hear instructions or callouts for fights in Final Fantasy XIV.

I also have a Elgato Wave 3 mic and I can still use the game/chat dial with the Elgato Wave Deck program, it just takes a little fiddling with. Ease of use is so great though!

The sound quality is not too bad, the only place I've noticed any dip in quality is with music. It still sounds good, but not quite as good as a Razer headset. The functionality of this headset supercedes that one teeny flaw for me.

Noise cancellation is pretty good too! There are dogs that live in the home that constantly bark when their owners are away, for hours at a time, and these headphones are the one thing saving my sanity from the incessantly borking doggos.

They wear so easily and are comfortable on my head. The velcro band at the top can be adjusted to fit probably any size head.

If you're even considering getting this headset, just do it. Please, just do it. Thank me later!",0,Positive

The bads: The sound dongle thingy is super sensitive and always keep getting accidentally shifted. Never came to use and it was a source of frustration.

Amazon Customer,4,03/19/2019,Black - Arctis 5,"These are great headphones, for the average gamer.","I was a bit skeptical at first when I first purchased these because of the differing reviews. Some totally hated this headset, and some praised them for being the best in the market. I decided to take the chance and buy them. When I received them I was scared of them being a bad headset. After taking them out of the box and plugging them into the USB port on my Playstation (which is what I use them on), I could tell that the sound was pretty decent for $100. I noticed that it sounded a little tinny but it seems to be going away after a week or two. It isn't that loud of a headset so if you prefer headphones that make your ears bleed than these aren't for you, but I don't need super loud headphones. The surround sound is pretty good and noticeable too. The mic is pretty good, I wouldn't say it is as good as advertised, it definitely isn't ""The Best Mic in Gaming"". The mic is good though and should be perfectly fine for gaming with friends. Now let's talk about the negatives. The biggest problem I have with the headset is that the cords are a mess and unnecessarily long. I also think they should get rid of the ChatMix dial because I don't see a purpose in really having it, also it is very sensitive so a little nudge will adjust the dial and possibly turn your game sound off. Another thing I don't like is that the ear cups are really shallow and the speaker is usually touching your ear which can sometimes get a little uncomfortable (although the head strap is really nice). The last thing is not the headphones themselves but the way they are advertised. These are advertised as the most high-quality headset on the market, but it is really just another average headset, they really hype it up for more than it is.
Pros
- The sound is pretty good for the price
- The mic sounds really good
- Pretty good surround sound
- The RGB lights look AMAZING
- Pretty convenient buttons
- Head strap is pretty comfortable

Cons
- Cords are a nightmare
- ChatMix Dial is kind of annoying
- Not very loud (really not a big deal)
- Ear cups really shallow",0,Positive
Anthony G,5,12/19/2020,Black - Arctis 5,Best headset I've ever had.,"I have had MANY headsets in my 16 years of computer gaming. Many of them were cheap, some were far more expensive at around $200. This headset has the BEST noise cancelling mic I've had. My wife and I play in the same room, 4 feet away from each other, and the mic on this thing doesnt pick her up, it doesnt even care that she's here, I even got her a pair! The sound is loud, noise cancelling in the headphones isn't the BEST, but it's still solid. I will always stick with steel series going forward, unless something DRASTICALLY changes my opinions.

Spinnerette,3,04/17/2022,Classic Black,Ouch!,"I was looking for a wired mouse (usually use wireless) for better gaming. I have kind of a modified fingertip/claw grip where the base of my knuckles rest on the mouse but not my palm, and within a couple hours of using this mouse my index and middle finger knuckles became incredibly sore to the point where I had to ice my hand several times and not use a mouse at all for the rest of the day and evening. Went back to my steelseries rival 3 the next day and the pain is gone. The buttons of this mouse curve upwards at the top instead of continuing to slope downwards and the shape is quite round. 3 stars bc the product itself is fine and I'm sure it works great for others, it just doesn't work for my grip.",0,Negative
Connor R,2,09/12/2023,Classic Black,Likely done with Razer,"Most of the complaints I have about this mouse are the same complaints I've had with every Razer mouse I've ordered in the last 8 years or so; middle mouse click sucks and always gives out way quicker than the rest of the buttons. This one just happens to have the extra negative of having a squishy feeling scroll wheel on top of that and it was giving off small little squeaks with every multi-scroll situation.
Additionally, the sensor on this was absolutely worse than my last cheap Deathadder ripoff and the build quality is barely better than that at 15 more bucks. Really not worth the cut in price from the higher tier edition wired Deathadder, but I didn't feel like dropping the $65+ that Razer prices those at when I had to replace them once every year or two because the middle mouse button gives out so quick.
I tried this one again after my cheap ripoff brand because I saw it at like $20 on prime sale, but honestly it feels the same as any mouse in the 10-20 dollar range so the real price is definitely not worth.
Overall, if you're like me and enjoy the shape of the Deathadder but hate Razer's software/build quality/general annoyances, there are other products to try instead on the cheaper and more expensive sides. I'm gonna be looking to try a more expensive option this next time though so I don't have to replace a mouse in a year again.",0,Negative

Well, I cried wolf too quick. I went to the razer forum and a proposed solution was to blow some air to remove dust, if any. I don't have compressed air, so I just blow some air with my mouth, and it fixed the issue. So 4 stars, the mouse is good.

They are also soft enough to keep on your ears for hours of gaming or listening to music if you wanted without feeling discomfort, the head strap is a nice touch for extra comfort. I really can't find anything wrong with them so for the price and quality I definitely recommend! Just watch the volume cause I almost blasted my ears off when I first tested them out😂",0,Positive

Ralph Matthew Santiago,5,07/02/2020,Black - Arctis 5,A great value!,"Hi! I got these to replace my turtle beach headset which is just getting old from usage. I use my headsets daily for hours so I feel I could definitely give a proper review.

Pro:
Great Noise cancellation. And mic noise cancellation.
Best mic I've used in a while. (I've gotten alot of feed back from my voice chat regulars saying I sound very crisp.)
RGB lights are fun and cool but the mute red light on the mic is very useful too! Practical not only ascetic.
Super comfy fit and cushions.

Cons:
If your looking for absolute noise cancellation, this isn't that, you can still hear some noises around you.
Mic is very clear to the point where my buddies hear me breathing haha! Just make sure to adjust and test the mic.
One size with adjustable ski band, this fit large on me so I dont have much room for adjustments.

This is a great value for the price your technically getting a headset id value at 150 to 175 with surround sound and very quality sound.",0,Positive

Oscar Martinez,4,06/21/2019,Black - Arctis 5,Overall a good headset. One downside,"The only thing I have to say about this headset is that it's already breaking which is a bummer, since I personally think steel series makes the best headsets.

First, noise cancellation is perfect, customized it in the software and works perfectly fine.

Great for gaming, mic quality is amazing and is certified for discord!

The last thing, is for the worst. I've had this for about a month now and its fuzzing out now.

First the mic automatically turns off by itself sometimes, but not often.

Second, when I first boot up my pc, I have to mute, and unmute my mic so I can hear sound, which is annoying.

And lastly if you're an RGB fan, there's a chance that it will stop working.. (Like mine). BUT overall an amazing headset!",0,Positive

Mark J. Koch,2,04/27/2023,Classic Black,For big hands only. For PC only.,"I was replacing my Orochi V1 and was surprised by how HUGE this mouse is. It's definitely for taller people. I plugged it into my MacBook Pro and it works like a mouse BUT... the adjustment range is useless. Even with the tracking speed slider at max, the mouse moves to slow. The Synapse software from Razer does not run on Macs. That would have at least helped with tuning the mouse, but no. This mouse has two left-side buttons like on the Orochi and on the Orochi, clicking those would adjust tracking speed on-the-fly (no drivers required). Not so with the DeathAdder. So for now I'm stuck with a sluggish mouse that cramps my hand. Visiting the Razer site was no help either, I couldn't find a corded mouse that would fit my hand. They also have not a single image showing the relative size of each mouse against each other. So my next experiment is to buy the $6 AmazonBasics mouse and see if that is any better. It promises to be smaller than the DeathAdder, but we will see. Don't buy the DeathAdder unless you are a large person with a PC.",0,Negative

John Schimminger,2,10/08/2021,Classic Black,Not the same.,"I had one of these years and years ago and it was a pretty solid mouse so I decided I'd pick one up for my laptop. Times have changed. It feels dirt cheap, the left and right buttons take practically zero pressure to click and the scroll wheel is basically useless. It clicks as you are gently scrolling every single time.
I would just buy a new one but I figure as cheap as this is made its not going to last much longer anyway so I'll see it to its grave shortly. However, if I were using this to game it would be going right in the garbage because as far as I am concerned it is absolute trash for gaming.

There is also a minor problem I have with the mic, where when I first use it, only static comes out (I tested this with my friends). To fix it you have to unplug and plug back in the headset and it’s fixed.

SumTiemZ,4,11/06/2019,Black - Arctis 5,Not SteelSeries quality headphones - Frost Blue was miles better.,"I bought a set of Siberia V2 Frost Blue SteelSeries headset circa 2014? The V2s I bought were used, on eBay, but lasted me up until this year. They never had any issues at all up until this year. That’s 5 YEARS of life out of a $60 pair of headphones. The sound quality was fantastic on those headphones. There was nearly no distortion and frequency response was incredible. I thought I may get another set of SteelSeries from the same quality, but these are lacking. Sound quality is no where near as good, doesn’t get as loud, and they feel somewhat cheap. Proprietary cables as well. They sound okay, but lack frequency response of the V2s and that’s a shame. I don’t expect these to last 5 years like my V2s, but I take care of my stuff. So here’s to hoping at least 3-4 years. This just feels like a cheap gamer aesthetic headset that focuses too much on RGB and looking fancy. The mic, however, blows the V2s out of the water - so that’s a big plus I guess. As far as comfy goes they also feel on par with my V2s. I’m just very disappointed in the sound quality and build.

Dunewolf,5,03/01/2024,10ft - Black,Works as advertised,I was using some other cables prior to this and noticed the slow charge rates.. At the time I did not suspect the cable being the reason for longer charge times / slow charging rate.. but after some testing with shorter cables and some reading into how cable thickness and length plays a role in charging rates (ie speed) - I decided to order a long cable marked for higher power rating / speed - well cable has lived up to its status.I still have the length needed to go from charger to my device while getting quick recharge times and even enough power to keep the device on while watching full length videos and still have power to charge battery.  so if you need a longer range from your plug in charger - getting a cable built for the power/length is important. so getting this will help your charging speeds be higher while not having to sit so close to plug.,1,Positive
Vini,5,05/03/2020,Black - Arctis 5,Best bang for your buck! 8.5/10,"It's pathetic how negative the comments for these headphones, as well as 90% of other gaming headphones, can be and how inaccurate they are. READ IF YOU ARE PLANNING TO BUY THIS HEADPHONE.

The pros and cons BELOW...
The sound quality is absolutely amazing, you can FEEL the sound vibrations and high quality it produces. The Steelseries headphones, this one, comes with a software you can install to customize your headphones, both physically and the audio engineering side of it; you can turn the bass up, down, completely customize the EQ.

The comfort of these headphones was a big deal to me, they are the only headphones that I can wear for 6+ hours in one sitting and feel like they're not even there. The comfort is ridiculously amazing with these headphones, so on that, I give them 10/10.

The catch is...the Steelseries software is a complete joke. Every time you turn on your computer to use these you have to unplug and plug the headphones back in if you want the full 7.1 surround sound feeling. Trust me, you'll feel a HUGE difference on how amazing it is when you feel the full potential of these headphones. But it's frustrating and ridiculous to have to do this EVERY SINGLE TIME you turn on-and-off your computer. If you don't do this, then you'll just get the basic quality the headphones delivers (which is still VERY amazing).",0,Positive

They don't create an air tight seal which sucks on your ears like leather cups, and they don't feel cheap or itchy like most cloth cups I've had the displeasure of wearing. The head band adapts nicely to the size of my head without needing to fumble with extensions or straps. It rests on your head snuggly, so you can look around without worry, but no so tight that it causes any sort of discomfort.

As important as comfort is, the main concern regarding all headsets is audio and audio quality. You won't be disappointed with these! Just out of the box, they deliver amazing audio quality across the spectrum, and by enabling surround sound in Steelseries' software, you get clear and immersive surround sound which delivers concise positional audio. The microphone also delivers great clarity, with the audio quality coming close to most consumer end dedicated mics.

I definitely recommend this headset for anyone looking to game or chat. They look nice, sound great, and feel good. I'd go as far as to say that they're a steal at $99.99.",0,Positive

Caio G.,5,06/05/2020,Black - Arctis 5,Amazing!,"I previously had a cheap headset for gaming/music that I kind of used universally. It worked fine and I got out of it what you would expect out of a cheaper headset. I decided to upgraded to the Arctis 5 for better quality in both gaming and music and I have not been disappointed. They are so amazingly comfortable, and easily capable of being used for long periods of time without hurting your head or ears. The ear cups are very cushioned and the head band feels like the band of ski goggles. As far as fit goes, they're amazing.

The sound quality is very good. I was impressed at how good it actually was. I'm no audiophile, but these sound amazing. If you download the steelseries engine software, you can customize preset profiles for gaming (and even for specific games) and music, where you can adjust the equalizer to personalize your sound. That same software is where you can control/personalize the RGB, which is purely aesthetic, but still looks cool. I've got different settings for music and gaming and there is a notable difference between the two.

I would definitely recommend this headset to anyone that is looking to upgrade. I'm sure there are discrepancies for audiophiles but if you're looking for an upgrade to a good headset, this is a really good choice.",0,Positive

Robert Valdovinos,4,09/27/2019,Black - Arctis 5,"Surpasses General Use - For Niches, however, It's a Mixed Bag","I got this headset hoping to upgrade from my ASTRO A10 headset.
Generally, there are more benefits than there are drawbacks.

While the headset audio quality is nowhere near that of ASTRO gaming, the Arctis 5 headset audio quality gets the job done

The microphone quality on the Astro A10 headset is mediocre, but the Arctis 5 build-in microphone quality and muting functionality are superb.

While the ASTRO A10 headset is bulky, durable, and very heavy, the SteelSeries Arctis 5 headset is comfortable, light, and disadvises any heavy-duty handling.

The product promises 7.1 Digital Surround Sound through its surround sound simulator software ""SteelSeries Engine 3"".
The software offers terrible ""surround sound"" as it just hampers the audio, so I just leave it off.
However, the software is more useful than most people review!
It offers a wonderful equalizer, microphone volume tuner, RGB-lighting earcup customizer, and microphone sidetone (which lets you hear yourself as you talk in the mic; it isn't ideal but it's there if you want to use it)
(I recommend the following equalizer settings:)
(62.5 = 4.1) (250 = 1.9) (1K = 0) (3.6K = 1.7) (12K = 1)

If there are two things that the Astro 10 headset does considerably better than the Arctis 5 Headset, it would be providing surround sound capabilities and in-line volume control.

I play a lot of shooters, and it is much easier to determine where sounds are coming from in the 3D digital space with the Astro A10 headset than the Arctis 5 headset.

The in-line volume control on the Astro A10 headset is more rigid and secure, while the volume control on the Arctis 5 left earcup is so sensitive that even picking up the headset would be enough force to turn the volume control wheel.

The delicacy of the game-chat audio mixer is ludicrous; just about any amount of force could turn the mixer wheel!

Finally, the way that the earcups on the Arctis 5 can turn inwards but can never outwards is a little disappointing as this headset has some serious personal speaker potential with its volume capabilities.

Now for my most favorite part of using the Arctis 5 headset! The Arctis 5 headset is great for listening to music!

This headset comes with two ports: the custom mini-USB and the 3.5mm audio jack ports.

I love that I can be able to 3.5mm Bluetooth Adapter, and it becomes a wireless headset!
It doesn't have the best audio quality, but this is a major upgrade from the Astro A10's incompatibility with anything less than 5-pole 3.5mm audio jacks in the earcups.
Granted that you also have a headset case, you can take the Arctis 5 headset and a 3.5mm Bluetooth adapter on the go!

You can wear these for much longer periods of time than any Astro headset, which is always a plus!",0,Positive

Subnet,4,03/23/2021,Black - Arctis 5,"High quality, well made, comfortable","I am still looking for the perfect fitting headset, as I have a large head and most will apply too much pressure for long 2+ hour gaming sessions. Out of going through 5 headsets all ranging from $50-$200, this has been the most comfortable so far!

Sound quality is good
My ears fit inside well.
The ear cups conform to your head a bit. Something I have found to be important especially for me since this allows it to fit better.

Cons
My head still seems to be a bit too big, and I have found that while the ear cups conform much better than others, the overall headset stretches a bit too much and causes a bit of pressure making it uncomfortable for extensive use.
For gaming though, I have used it for a few days now and just wearing it a couple hours a day seems fine!

I will continue to use this headset, and just carry on my search for a better fitting headset that my stupid head will be happy with!

Overall 4/5",0,Positive
Dave Piston,4,04/04/2021,Black - Arctis 5,Arctis 5 Wired Headset,"After researching wired headsets for a while I finally decided to give the Arctis 5 a try.

Lets start with the bad first:
Volume wheel feels cheap and loose (but does work well)
Hard to hear yourself even when you've maxed out the Mic Sidetone
Wires are super long which may be a downside for some. (My cat likes them a little too much)

Now the good:
Super, SUPER comfortable! Can't imagine a more comfortable pair of headphones. The strap is genius. Perfectly spreads the weight of the headphones over your head without any pressure spots and it's easily adjustable. The ear cups are made of cloth and memory foam which is great if you're like me and you hate leather or faux leather against your head (don't know if they can be washed but I'll have to find out). Besides the general comfort of it they also don't make you overly sweaty during long gaming sessions and because they're cloth it doesn't make a perfect seal against your head which can cause headaches from the pressure against your eardrums. The MIC is retractable which is a convenient feature and it's simple to adjust it to the perfect position. Everyone I've gamed with has stated the voice quality is good to great. Aesthetically they're simple and tasteful looking with a little bit of bling and eye candy with the configurable LED light rimming each ear cup. Sound quality appears to be pretty good for a roughly one hundo pair of headphones.

Besides a few minor quibbles the Arctis 5 wired headset is overall a VERY comfortable, decent sounding, nice looking pair of headphones for the money.",0,Positive

Gaming: you can hear everything in your game or movie. you can turn them up loud with out them popping

Noise cancellation: i cant hear my dog bark, my wife get mad at me or my kids complain its great.... until you take them off and get in trouble with everyone.

Sound quality: if you use the 3.5 cable it crackles unless you flip the USB-c cable i know it doesnt make sense but it works. when you twist the 3.5 it just keeps crackling you have to turn the cable around.

it comes with both usb and 3.5 cables, the 3.5 connection cable is very flexible and moves easy. the cable with the USB connection is pretty stiff gets twisted/ tangled very easy it also sits funny on your shoulder.",0,Positive

They finally got around to releasing a patch to unlock the rest of the locked out features. Given that, the product is now fully functional and as described at the point of sale. Rating is adjusted.
**************************************
To use these things to their full potential, you need to install SteelSeries Engine 3. That's no big deal, however to use the DTS functions you have to download additional software for the headset, and that process is currently broken. I emailed support, and their answer was ""we'll try to patch that in the future,"" marking my ticket solved without solving my problem. I paid for all of the features of these things, and they only delivered some of them.

This set is the only USB headphones I have that aren't at MAX volume all the time in Windows 10, which is a HUGE plus. I had given up on USB headphones in Windows 10.

The white version is prettier, the white LED backlighting is actually quite soft and much more pleasing to the eye.

Honestly, if you want the aesthetic, I'd still recommend it.

Razer - Please keep making the Essentials line - I'd like to get an 'Essentials PLUS', that has the same fixed DPI (Better, IMO - can't ever mess it up, and mouse performance is great like this), but with ARGB enough to have user set fixed colors.

Sam,1,05/12/2022,10ft - Black,Nylon thread comes apart after a few months,"Update 12/2023 lowered to 1 star:I bought this cable originally one year ago. After 5 months of use the Nylon Brading threads started to come loose right under the plastic ""plug"" and eventually could see the wires. Bought a new cable in August. Now 4 months later this cable is doing the same thing.It says it withstands over 12,000 bends. That is simply not true. After 8 months of use on the first purchase, and the 5 months after the 2nd purchase, both have had the same problem. Poor manufacturer and can't get a warranty replacement.--------Update: after about 10 days the manufacturing smell is finally gone from this Anker New Nylon 10ft USB C cable, so I was able to use it with the Samsung 50W charger next to my bed. Overall the build quality seems good and my Note 10+ recognizes the Fast Charge 2.0. Overall my main issue was the initial toxic smell from the cable when you take it out of the box, and took about 10 days to dissipate.--------Original review:I have used different Anker cables for years, but this New Nylon 10ft cable is the first one that I've used that has a strong toxic smell right of of the box. I couldn't use it to charge the phone next to my bed due to this toxic smell. I put the cable in another room and even outside and days later it still has this bad smell. I guess it's from whatever material is used during manufacturing. But after a week, I decided to return it and get a different Anker cable which is more like a rubber/silicone cover, but has no bad smell to it.",1,Negative

Here's the lowdown on why it's pretty cool:First off, it has this neat right-angle design. This means it sticks out to the side instead of straight out, so it's more comfy to use your phone while it's charging. No more awkward holding or bending the cable in weird ways.It charges your phone super fast, too. We all know how annoying it is to wait forever for your phone to charge. With this charger, you'll be back to using your phone in no time. It's like going from a slow old car to a speedy race car.The cable itself is really strong. You know how some chargers fall apart after you've used them a bit? This one doesn't do that. It's made to last, so you won't have to keep buying new ones.Plus, it's super long—over 6 feet! You can easily use your phone from the couch or bed without feeling stuck to the wall. It gives you freedom to move around while staying plugged in.So, if you're looking for a charger that's easy to use, quick to charge, tough, and long enough to give you space to relax, the Ainope USB-C Right Angle Charger is a great pick. It's a simple change that makes a big difference in how you charge your phone.",0,Positive

I don't know why I thought it would be different than any of the other Razor products I've owned. Razor is absolute trash marketed towards the gaming community. They look cool and have edgy names but the quality is just not there. The only reason Razor products are used by ""pro gamers"" is because they are gifted to them. Sure they might be good for a tournament but, are probably tossed out afterwards because they are unreliable for long term use and Razor will just provide new peripherals anyway. As long as they are seen using Razor products by the average Joe and e-sports fanboys.
Razor products also come with bloatware that may or may not affect the performance of your rig. This is something you don't have a choice in since factory settings are intentionally set to unplayable standards.
I have had much better success with other brands and even off-brands which cost less, last longer and perform better. Every Razor product I've ever owned hasn't lasted more that a year and has been replaced by something I am using two or more years later.",0,Negative
Ethan Schoonover,3,10/08/2021,10ft - Black,"Thinner than other 10ft, but that's an issue","Full disclosure: almost every charging cable I buy is from Anker. I settled on them long ago and have almost never been disappointed. That said, this is the first Anker cable I've had where I feel it could really do with some improvements.I own a couple other 10ft usb-c cables I bought before Anker had released a 10ft c to c cable (Uni brand, not going to say you should or shouldn't get those instead since I don't know if they have maintained their quality over time, I bought those years ago). The Uni cables I own are pretty thick, woven cable sheath. Similar to this Anker cable but thicker.It turns out that in a 10ft cable, thicker is better if you are going to be putting it away in a bag. Coiling it up and uncoiling it repeatedly means a thick cable won't kink up easily and will lie flat when unrolled.This cable is long enough and thin enought that it unfortunately kinks up a bit. Not much! but even one kink when unrolling it is inconvenient and makes me concerned that over time this may result in some twisting or excessive wear of the cable interior.I don't love how thick the other usb-c cables (the non anker cables) I own are. They've always felt... excessive. But I appreciate that they are heavy enough to basically never kink up.YMMV, but let this be food for thought. Anker, if you are listening, I'd prefer to see these a bit thicker or less kink prone.",0,Negative

mark,5,26/11/2023,10ft - Silver,Works great for charging and not to bad for file transfer,"It's nice having a 10ft cable that's capable of 100 watts of power delivery, but it's only a USB 2.0 data transfer cable so your limited to about 480mbps data transfer speed. But for a durable cable that feels like it's good quality for about $10 your not going to get it all! Most of us these days need the higher power capability of a cable these days anyway. And if you need to transfer some files 480mbps isn't all that bad.  That's 40MBps or 1GB in about 15 seconds. Which isn't bad for work files or some pictures. Now if your trying to transfer your entire phone contents that's 256GB like my galaxy S22 ultra then your going to go crazy waiting. But in that scenario your not trying to charge and your going to want a cable that can move data at the USB 3.2 rated speeds the phone is capable of, which would be a short 3ft long Thunder Bolt cable. To get fast transfer speeds the cable needs to be short and all your going to get from any computers USB port is 10 watts so all the wires needed to carry power are used for data which is fine because 10 watts is all a computer USB is going to give you anyway. So it really comes down to what you need.. data transfer get a thunderbolt cable and leave it plugged in to your PC, power delivery get a high wattage cable. Which USB 2.0 speeds are fine because it's only talking to the charger...",1,Positive

I purchased this mouse expecting it to be just as good as my previous Death Adder. I was disappointed when I discovered that the left mouse button had less travel and felt noticeably mushier than the right button. I understand that these buttons have manufacturing tolerances and they often don't feel exactly the same, so I tried to ignore it, but after several days of coding and constantly being aware of the mushiness of the left button compared to the right one, I was losing my freaking mind.

I still went with Anker because they used to have the best customer service out there and stood behind their products.After this cable died on me after one year, I went through the warranty process to get a replacement. After jumping through multiple hoops, sending a bunch of pictures, reiterating the same information already provided etc, I destroyed the defective cable per instructions and waited for a replacement. When it came I opened it up to find they sent me an obviously damaged, used cable in a taped up box.I’ve just about had it with Anker. I paid the upcharge versus their competitors for the knowledge they had the customers back. No longer the case. I’ll save my money next time and just toss the cable when it inevitably dies.",1,Negative

AwkwardAustin,3,10/28/2022,Classic Black,Excellent Mouse with Wheel Problems,"I'm on my third mouse.

Pros:
-Lightweight
-Good price
-Simple
-Pleasant ergonomics

Cons:
-At around 6 months, the mouse wheel will start to wear. It starts glitching out slowly at first. You'll be scrolling down in your browser and the page will jump up a bit. Then it becomes impossible to scroll.

It's like watching your pet age and begin to suffer. Except the pet's life expectancy should be a few years, instead of months.

I REALLY hope Razer can pickup the quality of this scroll wheel. It's the only mouse I'd ever use. I never eat or drink around my computer. I don't touch my mouse or keyboard with sticky fingers. I dust regularly. Just be forewarned, the scroll mechanism WILL wear out within a year.",0,Negative
Darya,5,03/12/2023,White - Arctis 5,Love it so much. Perfect for any gaming platform.,"I’ve had this headset for around 2 years now and it’s still going strong. Outlasted every other headset that I’ve ever had. This headset has good sound and microphone quality. I would recommend this headset even if you have a console like me, just plug it into the usb port in the back of your console and you’re good to go. However, if you have a console, the game/party audio scroll wheel doesn’t really work for anything other than lowering down the volume of the headset, which is why I don’t use it, I think this is more of a pc feature. But overall this headset is great and looks very aesthetically pleasing as well.",0,Positive
Erik S.,4,02/05/2020,Black - Arctis 5,First gaming head set ever!,"This is my first ever gaming head set. The first time I put them on the sound just blew my mind. I could hear things that I never knew were there before and I just could not believe it took this long for me to get a head set.

Sound quality: Sounds great and clear as I said above. I will say though, my wife wanted a head set after hearing mine and she got the playstation head set. I can’t remember the full name but they were like 90-100. Anyways, sound quality on those was so much better. BUT!!! Don’t let that take away from me saying that these SteelSeries still sound really good!

These are wired and the volume control on the cord is really sensitive. Sometimes I’ll try to move the cord and the knob just brushes against the floor a bit and changes the volume.

Mic: My friends say my voice sounds really clear and could hear a difference compared to my old mic that I was using. Mute button on the side is nice. Red light indicator on mic when mic is muted is also very nice

Overall good headset. I’m happy with it",0,Positive

Ilia,1,11/08/2023,Classic Black,The scrolling wheel start bouncing and reversing. Not reliable company,"Bought June 3 2023, after three months of use, the wheel stopped functioning normally (when scrolling, it starts jumping down and up)

In general, I do not recommend Razer company. I previously bought headphones from them, and their software immediately did not work on my PC (I found reviews of other people with the same problem). I contacted tech support, and this was my worst experience with tech support, which seemed completely incompetent to me. They never solved my problem, although I helped them as much as possible in this matter. They simply refused to solve the problem. I returned the headphones to where I bought them.

Unfortunately, I bought the mouse from them before the headphones, and everything seemed to be fine with it until that moment. I wrote to technical support now, since the return period on Amazon has already passed. I hope I can get my money back for this poor quality mouse.

And so, in my experience, there are already two devices from Razer - both do not work as intended, plus poor technical support (which is also not easy to reach, you need to answer a lot of questions first).",0,Negative

NopeNope,5,05/13/2023,Black - Arctis 5,Honestly tArctis' best headset.,"I've had this headset for 4-5 years and just bought another to replace it once it wears out completely.

I've also tried many of Arctis' other headsets, including the newer ones and none of them fit like this one does. I have a big head and all the newer versions of their headsets are too small, or put pressure in the wrong spots on my head, or the ear cuffs are too small and don't fit my ears.

I'm going to be real sad once all the Arctis 5's are gone, because they haven't made anything that measures up to it in terms of comfort since. I've tried Logitech's that has the similar headband style and I might have kept it, but the sound was garbage in comparison.

I just keep going back to my worn out Arctis 5 because it's still better than any new headset I can find right now.",0,Positive
Ash,2,02/24/2023,Classic Black,Scroll Wheel Jumps,"After only a few months the scroll wheel jumps horribly. Razor support was very unhelpful. After submitting my video evidence my claim was accepted to receive a replacement, then the replacement support sent me a passive aggressive message telling me they'll make a one time exception to replace the mouse after demanding further proof of it not working correctly. Honestly, not worth the hassle, I gave up trying to work with them for a replacement. This is probably a good mouse if you don't need to use the scroll wheel often.",0,Negative
Amazon Customer,4,09/02/2021,Black - Arctis 5,Great headphones for the price.,"Pros:
-Excellent sound for gaming and music (for the casual music listener, that is)
- Wonderful EQ and features built into app
- So dang comfortable, could wear them for long sessions without them becoming a factor
- Cups are soft and durable. Material doesn't peel.
- Party/Game audio knob is convenient.
- FPS gamers will enjoy the accurate audio cues.
- Clean appearance, fun RGB customization options.

Cons:
- For best audio, you can't wear most gaming glasses or a ballcap. Explained below;
If you wear anything that might lift the top of the ear cup from your head, you will compromise the low end of your audio. The cup MUST rest against your head around your ear, else your sound will be tinny.
- Can't find a very convenient location for the adjustment knob, it sort of just floats around my desk. (Hardly inconvenient, more of just a silly observation)
- Not ideal for console gaming, as you lose the all-important audio software, and must manipulate game/party volume through the console.

Another plus to mention, the mute light on the mic is super clutch (though it does not work when using headset with console)..",0,Positive

Not really happy about this purchase. It feels exactly the same but I am worrying about the rubber side piece as that has never degraded on my 2013 model, all the way to now in 2022, and I'm just not really happy with this 2021 remake of the 2013 deathadder.

tyler bruno,4,02/12/2020,Black - Arctis 5,Solid Budget Headphones,"Hey all, so I'm not too experienced in this field of the market. I had a hand-me-down pair of Turtle Beach X12's that lasted for around 12 years (they don't make em like they used to/Discontinued 🤔🤔)

I really enjoy these so far. They seem more flexible than the pair of headphones I have for my xbox, same manufacturer as above, though a much more over-designed model. Obviously, flexibility is not critical to the product but to my mind it will go a long way towards extending the longevity of this headset.

Sound Quality, I am hardly an expert on. When I listen to music, I can hear a deeper depth (more tones or even ""instruments"") than I would with say... stock speakers. This is a huge plus to me. That factor is what I like about headphones. As far as gaming goes... when I think of gaming headsets I think of ""footsteps,"" as considered in shooter games. The only shooter I seem to have played so far while owning these is Insurgency Sandstorm.
I think the directional quality of the sound is as good as can be expected for ~$60 dollars, maybe even better.
I know that after several rounds I am slightly keyed up and or shaking from the immersive quality of my gaming experience. I remember the gun sounds as excellent, whether this is from the game or headphones I'm unable to discern.

I would recommend these to a friend.
In a very subjective sense I like them better than I might have liked a highly branded pair. 🤟

K,1,10/16/2023,Mercury White,Poor quality mouse wheel,"I know its a cheaper entry level mouse, but the quality of the mouse wheel is a deal breaker. The wheel won't last long at all and will start jumping all over the place with inconsistent response. Its not even usable for web browsing, let alone gaming or anything else more productive after a few months of use. This is my experience with two of these things. If the wheel were better/lasted it'd be a great option.

Update: Setting this to a single star after attempting to deal with Razor to get support. They make it incredibly difficult. They required me to provide them proof of purchase and serial numbers 3 different times to even get a ticket going and then they go out of their way to be difficult. They actually suggested that the reason my mouse wasn't working is because the USB cord may not have been straight enough then that response will be followed by a note that they will close the ticket in 48 hours. They do everything they can to not provide you help or resolve your issue. Go with something else, anything else.",0,Negative

Black Blade,4,01/02/2022,Black - Arctis 5,Great headset the lights are a little too much,"I got the SteelSeries Arctis 5

I do love the headset its gives good sounds and good options from its settings
The dangle allowing to make chat or game take more over the sound than the second one is great and the option to disconnect the cable from it makes it really easy to pick up and take away with my laptop

I would have rated it 5 stars however the mic led to allow me to know if the mic is active or not that is great, however, is too strong making it really stick out on calls where you can see my left side shine in red color as well as it floating my eye when the mic is out (not pulled back into the headset), and there is no option as much as I was able to find to control it (turning the led on or off by choice) and its the main reason for the 4 over 5 stars

Besides that the mic works well the headset comes in a good box with 3 cables 1 headset to the proprietary cable ending and from there can go into the Chat/Game dangle with a longer cable into the USB of the PC or a shorter cable that turns to a 3.5 connection that is great if you got a Mic/Speaker connection on a phone or laptop

I world recommend this headset over all

S. Huang,5,07/03/2019,Black - Arctis 5,"Wired, Steelseries Arctis 5 Review","After vacuuming up the cord of my very old Razer Cacharias (?) headset, it finally declared its death when my Discord group mentioned I was cutting in and out, and so it was time to replace my headset. For a very terrible 3 months, I bought a discount headset with plasticized ear cups, and while I could hear and communicate, it was very uncomfortable. I was looking into other Razer alternatives but didn't really feel as if their features were as interesting as the Steelseries, and I also had a few recommendations for Steelseries from others. Attach to it RGB function (my tower is needlessly fluorescent) and I decided to plop down the funds for this wired version. I've never been a fan of wireless, just something about connection and not having to worry if the wireless is up in a clutch moment is just my style.

The headset is very stylish. I'm a small person, with an average size head and average but slightly pokey-outey ears. The fabric and the stretch fabric on the headset is very comfortable and breathable. It angles just a touch forward when I wear it, which is not noticeable after a few minutes. The retractable microphone works very well, and my raid leader says I'm very crisp - definitely not the case with my knockoff cheapo headset.

Length of the plug leading from the headset to the dial toggle is very generous, as well as from the dial toggle to the computer. Due to USB hogging I have to use the top of my tower USBs, but no problem at all, very forgiving in length. I haven't had it fall out yet but I'm not headbanging while raid healing. The dial toggle is very cool! I can use it to easily mute out game noise if there's an issue, or vice versa if everyone is just talking about nothing and I want to tone them down. At neutral, it's equal for both.

RGB functionality is initially a bit complicated looking but is through Steelseries' app that you can download, and you can make separate profiles. I have a violet/blue shifting thing for my Tauren Shadowpriesting and have several other profiles - glowing gold for my paladin, green for druid, etc. And there are sound function toggles.

Sound is great, crisp, and no reverb at all. The surround function at least in World of Warcraft is excellent and positionally is usually great, although for some reason sometimes when I'm mounting up on a specific mount the sound will originate more to the left, but, this isn't always, and maybe is a function of my setup.

I especially like this for Youtube progressive house mixes, bass turned up! The noise cancellation is not really cancellation, but the muffling is enough that it takes out more ambient noise. I live by a freeway though, so there's nothing killing that noise. Definitely softer.

I really like this headset. I would recommend if you're in the market, give this a good try, I hope mine has a lot of life left in it. It's a lightweight headset and the cords are fairly lightweight but give you great range.

Also a good wow factor, if anyone is watching you game, and I can make it match my tower RGB, hah hah. The little things, eh?",0,Positive

They are extremely comfortable for all-day wear, and the ear pads won't break down easily, even after months of wear. After working from home and wearing these every day for great lengths of time, they still feel like new. Very very high quality.

My only problem with them is that they basically act as shooting range earmuffs as well. I can barely make out anything my wife is telling me from ~7 feet away with these things on. On the upside, the volume being pumped through the headphones can be kept rather low and your ears can be preserved because everything else becomes so silent by comparison.

As for the audio quality it is very good. If you've got a high definition audio chipset or sound card then these headphones should sound fantastic with games.

Directional hearing, sound quality are top notch. The Discord voice chat to game chat knob is super convenient for those annoying friends that can't be quiet and let you listen to foot steps. Build quality is A1. Suspension bands are a must to stop the top of your head from hurting for after long game sessions. The mic slides in and out easily and has a nice bright LED letting you know you are muted forwhen your mom starts to tell at you to go to bed late at night. Cables aren't braided but are high quality tangle free and super long. Steelseries engine works which is nice.

I use for PC and it's amazing, I hear it's not so amazing for the console bros. Look elsewhere if you aren't PC.",0,Positive
Bruce Ikelheimer,4,05/12/2020,Black - Arctis 5,"Great headphones, not great fit for small heads","Absolutely loved the sound on these. Felt like I was in the same room as Lara Croft (wow!) Music also sounded great on these, and the microphone quality was excellent. The only downside to these wonderful headphones was that they did not fit my head. They fell off anytime I looked down or leaned back. The clamping force is so loose that they barely covered my ears, and adjusting the tightness of the strap on top was highly confusing. If you've got a larger sized head, then I would definitely recommend these headphones. The sound was clear, the mic was beautiful, and the design is suuuuper slick. If your head is on the smaller size, however, the headphones simply do not fit.",0,Positive
