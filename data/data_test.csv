Cameron Germano,3,01/04/2023,Mercury White,You Get What You Pay For,"This mouse is a great value, but it is priced that way for a reason. It lacks the features of the more premium Razer products I have become accustomed to. There is no soft grip or felt pads. The cable is not braided. There aren't customizable LED options. But if none of those are a big concern to you, this mouse is great for the price. It isn't the most comfortable option I have used, but I wouldn't say it is uncomfortable either. For many it is a good option",0,Positive

Gindjurra,5,10/30/2023,Classic Black,The best all around basic gaming mouse I've ever owned,"Like the headline says - and to expand on it, this is my fourth purchase of this model. All mice wear out, especially ones for click-heavy uses like gaming. This one is IMPOSSIBLE to beat for the price - more expensive mice often have higher resolution or fancier button layouts, but they routinely cost three times as much, and don't last any longer before wearing out. Reliable, cheap and precise - there's none better than a Razer Deathadder.",0,Positive
James Seedorff,2,11/09/2021,10ft - Black,"Feels like bait and switch, not 100w capable","PROS: Long USB C to USB C cable.CONS: Does not allow 100w charging.I purchased this cable to go with my docking station and power supply for my laptop. it says it is compatible with 20v 5A 100W charging, but when I connect it... all my devices say it is not compatible. Alternative cables work in same configuration. I trusted Anker, and they let me down. Note that this states USB 2.0. My research indicates I need USB3.1 for my devices. One of the images even states it support 100w power transfer, but it does not on my devices. While this cable does work and meet my basic needs, it does not meet the intended job for my purchase.",1,Negative

Amazon Customer,4,23/04/2021,10ft - Black,"Great cable, but the Velcro strap isn't very good","This is the most recent of a number of ANKER products I've purchased. The cable is great and even supports HD video, but the little hook and loop strap is too short and doesn't stay on the cable. While this doesn't affect the cable, it's kind of a pain and the similar straps on prior cables worked well and still work well.",1,Positive
Efrain s.,5,02/13/2023,Black - Arctis 5,Purchased may 2020,To this day it works just the chat dial mix part is a bit loose. If only i could replace that it would be just like new. Still my daily headset and will continue.,0,Positive

Kylie,5,01/14/2022,Black - Arctis 5,Stylish and Comfortable,"Hardware: This is the most comfortable headset I’ve ever worn and being able to hide away the mic when not in use is a plus. I like that the dial to adjust the level between game/chat and the volume control are used by physically turning them. The mic lights up when it is muted, which is nice but does cause a little glare on my glasses. It’s a minor complaint all things considered.

Sound: The driver software is easy to use, and I like that there are both preset options and individual controls to adjust the sound to the use case. I keep it on the music setting most of the time. The mic picks up really well even when I speak softly. I wouldn’t call these noise-cancelling, but it dampens outside sound enough for my uses.",0,Positive

Paul,4,07/18/2023,Classic Black,It's good but not great,"I just bought this to replace my older DeathAdder from 2013. They both have a 6400 dpi sensor but this newer one feels a little cheaper. For example, it feels slightly lighter in weight and the buttons are a little louder and ""clackety"" sounding. Also, the cord is no longer braided, so it's now just a cheap plasticized cord with lots of kinks in it from being wrapped up in the packaging. I'm sure it will work fine but I may decide to upgrade to a better model.",0,Positive

Mike S.,4,12/11/2020,Black - Arctis 5,An excellent pair of headphones,"Pros:
* Good sound quality. I'm not sure what others are complaining about. They are much better than my HyperCloud headset, not quite as good as my Sennheiser HD 280 PRO but close (which of course dont have a mic, cost the same).
* Work great in Linux, which is somewhat of a miracle given the state of sound in Linux.
* Fancy RGB color shifting
* You can plug in a 3.5mm audio cable and it mixes it in with USB audio. This is nice for playing guitar for example, and not needing a separate mixer to mix the PC + guitar amp.
* Convenient controls, voice clear, overall very satisfied.

Cons:
* Proprietary cable
* Biggest complaint: I often find the USB cable gets unplugged. Perhaps this could be solved by a bigger USB cable between the proprietary dongle and headset (the one that ships is maybe 3.5 feet?). But if it pulls out at a critical moment (during a raid etc) it's a big problem.

Overall, I'm very satisfied and it's more than I expected given the cost.",0,Positive
Ashton Cooper,5,02/25/2024,Classic Black,"""Essential"" is the right word!","There are a lot of different gaming mice out there but a lot of gaming mice on the market in my opinion kind of just over do it. They are just way to expensive or have to many unneeded features (like 12+ buttons, covered in rainbow RGB lighting, wireless or have a super weird shape/feel)

I just need a simple gaming mouse…

I was at tech-school for my training in the Air force (I know, weirdest place out of anywhere) and I had my gaming laptop mailed to me so on my days off, I could play games with my sister & friends. For a long time I used a basic Dell computer-lab work mouse, and it gets the job done but I thought maybe it was time for a fun upgrade. There was a GameStop at a mall and there I bought a white colored Razer DeathAdder Essential Gaming Mouse. I'm going to tell you now… I immediately LOVED it! Perfect balance of a gaming mouse with some cool features but not overdoing it. Exactly as it says in the name… it's the basic essentials for a gaming mouse! And for the price of $30? Not bad at all.

The size, shape and feel is really good. not overdoing it in my opinion, giving a great ergonomic feeling when in use. The two extra side buttons are great and not overbearing (like with some mice and their 6+ extra buttons all over the mouse) two, in my opinion, are just enough. Lastly the fact that it's wired is nice, helps with price & simplicity. It has some RGB lighting but not all over the place or crazy so no complaints for that.

I rebought one but in the color black so it better matches my laptop and gave my sister the white colored one. Had the white one for almost a year and had ZERO issues or problems with it. If you want a simple, nice and cool gaming mouse that is just the ESSENTIALS this is for you!!!!",0,Positive

Doiv,3,09/20/2023,Classic Black,Mouse wheel jitters after only 7 months!!,"I am SO tired of my gaming mouses getting wheel jitters. I scroll down and it'll register some of it as scrolling up, meaning if a game has keybinds with the mousewheel like Monster Hunter World, then it messes up your gaming. Also my left clicker is starting to double click and not being able to hold it so I can drag things. It's ridiculous this is happening after only 6-7 months of owning it and light gaming.",0,Negative
Bill,2,09/20/2023,Mercury White,Bouncing scroll wheel of death,"Mouse was awesome for 2 months smooth, affordable, fast. Then the scroll wheel started bouncing, meaning if I scroll down it will bounce scroll up and down and vice versa. So it takes 2-4 times as long to scroll on a page. Made it impossible to game and just mind-blowingly annoying to use day to day. Read online people said to blow air into it. I did a can of air and with my mouth, sometimes it would help for a little bit but not really. Seems online this is a known common issue, prob just need to go with a different mouse.",0,Negative

Santiago,1,01/10/2024,Classic Black,It broke out of the blue.,"I bought it a year ago, however, I'm not a person who uses the computer a lot, only to check emails or write documents, so I didn't use the mouse practically for anything either. Until now that I'm going to use my computer, I realize that without having even touched it, the cursor was automatically directed to the corner and no matter how much I moved the mouse, it stayed in the corner. I disconnected it to see if I had pulled the cable or if it was a problem with the USB port and no, it was the mouse. I practically didn't use it, much less neglect it, and it got damaged anyway.",0,Negative

bigcountrybaloo,5,04/03/2024,10ft - Black,Anker cables are always solid,"Anker cables are always my first choice when looking for a new cable to meet my needs. I bought this USB C to USB C 10’ cable to allow for charging my computer while working on schoolwork and to allow the cable to lay flat along the ground from the plug, and my 6’ cable didn’t accomplish that.

Matthew Graham,3,11/30/2022,Classic Black,Scroll Wheel Doesn't Work Properly,"I like everything about this mouse except for the scroll. The problem is that I use the scroll wheel a lot. If you scroll fast the scroll has super unpredictable results. When you scroll fast down a webpage it scrolls down and then back up even though you are just scrolling down. It's frustrating enough for me to stop using this mouse. I am going to either get another mouse or use my old mouse.

I did take the mouse apart and cleaned the internal scroll mechanisms and it started working for a little bit, but it's back to being its old tricks. So I'm done with it.",0,Negative
Amazon Customer,4,22/11/2022,10ft - Black,This cable is great value for money,I received this cable and I was immediately impressed with the quality . The braided cable was done well and seems like it will last some time. It does support the 100w charging as long as you have a 100w compatible charging dock. I use an iPad Pro m1 12.9 and it was able to completely charge from 8% to 100% in a little over an hour with me using it. Highly recommend. My review is based on first impressions and my experience with product after one week.,1,Positive
Abby Valdovinos,5,12/01/2024,3.3FT+3.3FT - BlueNumber of Items: 2,Longer lifespan,The cable has a nice and durable feel to it. It has the rubber support around the areas that tend to get worn out and split which is a huge pro. Another thing that I really like about this cable is that the actual phone plug is at a right angle. I prefer these much more that the straight style because you constantly have to bend those which causes unnecessary wear on the cable. The right angle and rubber bumper will make this cable last much longer than your average cable would.,1,Positive
Jacob L.,5,07/22/2020,Black - Arctis 5,Wanted To Wait A Few Months Before Writing This Review,I was recommended this brand of headphones. I loved the face that it had RGB lights on each cup. I am a RGB fanatic. I pulled the trigger on the wired ones. I didn't want Bluetooth especially for gaming. I love how long the cord is. That is awesome. Now I def don't like the type of connection that goes from the DAC to the actual headphones. Its a unique type connection. As for sound quality these are amazing. Especially in COD it sounds like you actually there. For music it sounds awesome. Now def download the software. And def turn on 7.1 Surround sound. These sound horrible with out that on. They sound like tin cans. Equalizer is really good. I love that you can boost up dialogue and bass. Great for music. Not so great for video games. As when you boost the bass video games gets drowned with bass. My issue is how flimsy sometimes the connection to the actual headphones are. Theres times where I move my head and the connection seems to go in and out. Audio sounds far away. But just a tight push and it works with no issues. Idk it could just be me but I dont know how these are rated as the best mic in gaming. Im sorry but I have heard ASTRO headphones that are 30 bucks sound better. I def use a Condenser XLR mic. I dont use the mic on this headset at all. For the price I paid I def like these. I would buy them again. And honestly I would recommend these to anyone.,0,Positive
emily,5,03/02/2024,Classic Black,Love,"Got as a gift for my sister but when I set it up for her I was a bit jealous and went and got myself one. That was her birthday almost two years ago, they're both still in regular use.",0,Positive
Benjamin,2,05/20/2023,Classic Black,a true disappointment,"i bought this mouse back in february as a birthday gift to myself since my last mouse was a borrow from a friend. after i received it in the mail i played with it and it was okay, kind of awkward to press the buttons but i have small hands so i don’t necessarily believe that to be the mouse’s fault. however, three months after playing games with it, it has abruptly stopped working, i cleaned the sensor with a q-tip, nothing. i uninstalled and reinstalled USB drivers on my computer, nothing. i even downloaded their dumb companion app or whatever onto my computer (because of course it has to have one) in the attempt to factory reset it. all buttons on it work, clicking, scrolling, the side buttons. just not the sensor. no remedy has worked and it’s pitiful retirement has left a terrible unreliable impression on me for the razer brand.",0,Negative
james heapes,5,10/09/2023,Classic Black,top quality mouse for serious gamers,"i think its sturdy, large (i like big), accurate, sensitive but not intrusive
i play a game using a mouse and my previous cheap mouse broke.
at first i thought my pc was broke or had a virus, but a new mouse resolved the problem.
then i searched for a truly quality mouse and i found this legendary mouse with a nice celtic symbol on it (im irish btw) so i bought it. it looks good, feels good, and is accurate and sturdy,
way more comfortable than my tiny previous mouse, this new mouse fits the whole hand like silk,
and makes sweet love to your computer games with the skill of the most intimate maestro
get this mouse even if you have a mouse",0,Positive
kelsey,2,02/24/2023,Classic Black,"**Initially good, but does not last!**","ORIGINAL REVIEW: It's perfect for me. It's a bigger mouse and I love that. I have multiple more expensive Razer gaming mice and prefer this one for prolonged use. Amazing price for what you get. It is only the green illumination, so it's not RGB if that bothers you!

UPDATE to 2 stars!: the scroll wheel now skips and is awful. Extremely disappointed. I have 2 razer mice, the other 1 costs 3 times as much as this one, yet they both have developed this issue. These mice aren't even used for gaming, just office work. I was a big razer fan but have been switching to SteelSeries pretty steadily as the quality is very poor and declining in recent years in Razer products. I used to own only Razer peripherals (accessories) for the computers, but now it is only these 2 faulty mice and a headset which is very touchy and has constant issues.

I would save my money and not buy this. Get something similarly priced that will last you longer. SteelSeries for example, however there are others which are better quality than Razer at an equal or lower price.",0,Negative
John A. And George,2,08/25/2023,Classic Black,Unreliable Scroll Wheel,"Overall a good mouse, except for the scroll wheel starting to jump around after a month of use. Thought I could rely on a Razer mouse, but guess I will have to find a different one.",0,Negative
Stephanie D.,4,01/21/2022,White - Arctis 5,Great,"I bought this for work (gotta love those Zoom meetings). Audio is great, and definitely tunes out background noise on my end. I struggle with the mic because it loves to pick up every piece of noise, which then cuts the audio on my video call. I wish the mic/headset came with a small foam mic cover to try and filter the excess noise.

Aside from that, they are a very comfortable and versatile headset.",0,Positive

Jonathan Moore,5,09/10/2021,Black - Arctis 5,good headset no major complaints,"I like the headphones. They are comfortable and they are very good priced for what you get. My only real complaint is the implementation of the Chat/Game Dial, I absoloutely hate this thing. I accidentally move it which makes my volume lower, and there should just be a software override for this thing. It would be much better if it controlled perhaps windows audio (while there is a hardware volume wheel on the headset) and I just found that i just uninstalled the arctis5 game audio and it just fixed that, but regardless other than that, good headset for anything really good balance great for music.",0,Positive

EmbeddedFlyer,2,02/11/2022,10ft - Red,"Has compatibility issues with multiple laptops, stiff, bulky, Anker FAIL","Anker has, in the past, been among the best brands for cables and chargers but they seem to have lost their way. I have various laptops and other devices that charge with USB C and this cable only works with about half of them while Anker's earlier cables work with all of them. What's going on Anker??? You're going backwards.Even using this cable with 3 different Anker PD chargers, it refuses to charge one of my M1 Mackbooks, two of my Dell laptops, and my 12 inch M1 iPad Pro. Using a 2 year old Anker USB C cable with those same chargers and laptops works perfectly.And this cable is very thick, rather stiff, and just not very user friendly. It doesn't coil up well for storage and it doesn't like to lay flat when in use. The stiffness also puts extra stress on the USB C port of whatever device it's connected to. And the USB connector itself has rather high insertion force compared to most cables which also will likely stress the USB port on your device.The issue isn't how much current this cable can carry as, using a USB C power analyzer, it can deliver 60+ watts to devices it's compatible with. It appears the issue is how it's wired/configured as some devices just refuse to charge with it.Anker needs to do MUCH better. They're charging a premium price for a clearly inferior product.",1,Negative
Amazon Customer,2,02/04/2024,Classic Black,Was great until the left click stopped working,"This mouse was a great mouse. It worked, the software was great, and it didn't feel cheap or tacky. However, I haven't had it for a full year and the left click is now super inconsistent -- sometimes it doesn't register when I click, and sometimes if I hold down the mouse button (click and drag, which I have to do a lot) it will act as though I halted my click partway through. Nothing precipitated this, I didn't smash the mouse, it just stopped. Really sucks because I loved the mouse. Now I will probably be switching to a Logitech mouse.",0,Negative

Michael Rodrigues,1,07/19/2023,Mercury White,"Worst Scroll Wheel Ever, DO NOT RECOMMEND FOR YOUR SANITY!!!","Purchased this mouse awhile back because I needed a good white mouse for my all white PC build. Worked great for a couple a months, until the problem started happening. Out of nowhere the mouse's scroll wheel started misbehaving and became jumpy. Scrolling up would randomly cause it to scroll down (and vice versa) or it would just scroll in place, refusing to scroll at all. It became incredibly frustrating to deal with. I started looking online to see if others had this issue, and it turns out it's an issue that Razer has never addressed. So I started to look at solutions on Reddit. Everyone said to just replace the mouse, but I didn't want to just incase the problem could be fixed. One person said that ""blowing really hard into the scroll wheel or using a can of compressed air could fix it."" So i tried just that. It worked for about a week and I was relieved. Then it started happening again to the point where eventually blowing into the scroll wheel only fixed it long enough for a single Call of Duty match. I finally was fed up with it and replaced the mouse soon after. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!!!",0,Negative

Jesse Boyd,2,12/19/2022,Classic Black,Razor needs to stop pumping out garbage.,"I had a DeathAdder about 5 years ago. It only lasted 3 years, then the scroll wheel broke and was unfixable. It was a great mouse until that point, but I wasn't going to spend ~$50 for another mouse that only lasted a few years.

Fast forward I see these going for sub $20. ~$20 for a good mouse with a great sensor that may only last a few years I can live with. THREE WEEKS IN the mousewheel is skipping around. Blasted it with compressed air as some recommended, problem starts creeping back within hours. This is completely ridiculous. I can accept a bad roll of the dice, but two in a row? Apparently Razor is some over-hyped trash.",0,Negative
Paul E. Fisher,5,02/03/2024,Classic Black,Nice essential mouse for gaming,"Sure you can pay a lot of money for gaming mouses. But Razer Deathadder Essential does enough without being too overwhelming. It has two buttons for your thumb and a very quick reaction to your movement. The scroll wheel is clickable and freely moves with many stops to keep it in exact positions.

Dwise1,3,01/23/2024,Mercury White,Stopped Working Reliably Within 9 Months,"Sadly I was very pleased with this mouse right up until it stopped working reliably only 9 months after purchase. The mouse still completely functions, however, when clicking and holding the left button, it will occasionally ""let go"" of the click function (even though the button is still fully clicked), meaning whatever files I'm in the process of dragging get dropped wherever the cursor happens to be -- which is really problematic in my line of work as a video editor.

I realize it's not the most high-end mouse, and I was using it almost daily for those nine months, but to not even make it one year is highly disappointing.",0,Negative
Amazon Customer,4,05/20/2023,Mercury White,Did not have rubber sides. Good budget mouse,"My razer naga (2014 model) cable frayed recently so I decided to get this mouse while I wait for the new usb lead part to arrive. The mouse is the deathadder essential but the cable is rubber instead of braided and the sides are textured plastic instead of rubber. I'm fine with that but the images are not correct and it would be nice to fix that.
As for the mouse it's a good shape and works well but I find that it's not as nice feeling as the other razor products. My Big complaint is the sides are slippery since its just plastic but grip tape could help. I'm also not a fan of the deep arch in the left side but that's personal preference.
Overall conclusion: it'll work if you are tight on money but If you are willing to spend a little bit more I think the deathadder v2 would be a better buy.",0,Positive

This is apparently a newer, lower-quality model - they've replaced the braided cable with a rubber one. The side grips are NOT rubber, they are plastic. I've also noticed that the buttons seem much more sensitive than the older model, so I keep accidentally clicking. As with all Razer mice, expect your scroll wheel to deteriorate within a few months.

Design-wise, I love this mouse. It's so much simpler than other gaming mice, its side buttons are unobtrusive, and there's no giant DPI button in the middle. The profile and weight feel great. But it's really, really cheap. I won't be buying another one after this.",0,Negative

Size adjustment on them is not the best the adjusting of the headband is kinda annoying being it doesn't stick well sometimes but overall if you can get past that it fits and feels great even for extended computer times. Only real issue I had was the volume they dont get very loud you have to use windows loudness or another program to boost them but overall sound quality is nice and and they have a full sound to them. You may have to tweak them some in the equalizer to get them where you want them but overall nice sound and the lighting on them is subtle its enough to add the extra flair and RGB to your setup with out being over the top or distracting and clunky looking. Build quality is great they are light and made with decent material so they feel like the real deal vs some slapped together pair you would usually see around the price point. Overall they get a solid 4 out of 5 from me the slight noise that gets through and the sound not being as amp'd as I like is why but overall I would recommend them to anyone looking for style and color to there setup.,0,Positive

Happy Reader!,5,01/11/2023,Classic Black,Great mouse for the value.,"I needed a high quality laser mouse. I play FPS games. Not ""professionally"" and I don't even intend to try. I imagine there is a need for very advanced mice. So if that is you, maybe check reviews by people who intend to game+stream for a living to ensure you are getting the really in-depth look and the best information. If you need durable laser mouse and enjoy games, and are trying to find that sweet spot between buying quality and not breaking the bank, I think this is your mouse. I probably got it on sale, but my Logitech M500s broke a second time (RIP good buddy) I decided I would just try a new mouse. That Logitech was basically everything I needed and wanted in a mouse but I figure Razer made nice stuff and I wanted to try a simple corded mouse with a few extra buttons. This was everything I needed and more. It has 1) a light on it and 2) some software to install. I didn't really want to but I installed it. I think you have to register. I did. It wasn't a pain but it's a mouse. You should plug it in and use it and that's it. The bad thing is the light. It's a green light and bright. That's completely unnecessary. You can easily turn it off with the software you install and I did. Beyond that, I have everything I need. It feels great in the hand. The additional buttons are in sensible places and that helps with games. The scroll-wheel is just fine. Great mouse! Turn the light off and it is even better.",0,Positive

I've tried contacting razer support, which was a huge hassle to even start a warranty claim with them.

Anker, can you replace my defective 10ft 100w cord?  It's only a few months old and is already not working properly.",1,Negative
AEK,2,09/19/2023,Classic Black,Quality has gone down,"Razer mice used to be nice. I had a couple in the past. They all eventually died due to physical breakdowns. Hard to troubleshoot, to clean and maintain. The first Deathadder when released, it was great. The other one purchased, I have noticed a drop in quality and them feeling inferior.

With this one, it died on me within a year. Wheel started misbehaving - would scroll up and down on its own. Time to clean. Went and opened it and removed the two wheels (large one and smaller one). The led under the large scroll wheel is positioned so that the removal of the wheel is almost impossible. Most likely you will break the motherboard sitting inside the wheel with the led light. I did. The way it was placed there you think they did it intentionally so you cannot remove wheel to clean.

The smaller wheel (internal, and connected to the larger scroll wheel) was a pain to remove out for cleaning. I cleaned it, but nothing good came out of it. Large scroll wheel stopped responding. I suspect the combination of it and the smaller wheel is the problem. I tried a few times to set it in and have it work, but to no avail. Not responsive.

Razer should be concentrating on making lasting mice (but again, in this age, they want to sell you 10 mice over the course of 10 years - good business practice, environmentally bad... but I digress). The led lights too should not be a primary focus of the mice. Should be longevity of mouse not flashy lights that will blind you in the dark. Sure, you can disable them via software, but why not have them disabled by default. I think most people want a mouse to play and use and not flashing lights and distractions.

Fact that it is super hard to clean, and that you will break the internals is almost guaranteed with this one. I had to throw mine out, not working. My attempt to clean made it worse. Not happy nor impressed with this one. I am getting the wired SteelSeries Rival 3 for a similar (+/- $5 difference) hoping it will last longer.",1,Negative

This is amazing when you are playing a game and connected to discord talking to friends. One simple turn of a knob and you can turn chat up vs. game or vice versa.

The software is absolutely horrible. The 7.1 surround sound is filled with crackles and clipping even at low volumes making it unusable for anyone who cares about what they hear. That leaves the software to only control the lighting, which you can't even see because it is on the side of your head.

Tristan,5,01/21/2024,Black - Nova 3,Incredible software and the cleanest looking headset I've owned.,"After owning the headset for a few months, the only hiccups I've ever had regarding it was with the RGB. The software wasn't changing the colors for a while, but when I got around to fixing it I just had to tweak a few settings to fix it.

With the cons out of the way, this headset are by far the best I've ever owned. The unboxing experience was very memorable, the design of them are perfect, and it's the most comfortable headset I've had the pleasure of wearing (especially with my glasses on). And that's not even getting to the audio and software. The software that you download to adjust the headset is literally a must have if you want these to sound their best, but when you download it you'll be in for a surprise.

The software itself comes with almost anything a gamer could want from it. There's clipping software that's actually really good and efficient, there's giveaways they host for different games, and even an aim trainer for competitive gamers. The audio itself isn't noticeably better than any other headset I've used, but with the software it's able to achieve new heights. This easily blows any other headset out of the water that I've used in the past.",0,Positive
dt2008,3,16/10/2023,10ft - Black,Worked perfectly for 6 months then intermittent connection issues,"Worked perfectly for 6 months then intermittent connection issues when charging using an Anker 40W charger brick.

I enjoyed the cable until it started cutting in and out. The braided cable appears to be perfectly fine but the connection drops. I always roll the cable back up after using it for charging, perhaps it cannot be rolled and is therefore so durable, despite the braided cabling looking perfect? Disappointed it only lasted 6 months. The original Apple MacBook Air 2018 cable isn't braided, and it took 3.5 years before it started to have connection issues.

Rat Wrangler,2,01/21/2023,Classic Black,"After a Few Months, the Scroll Wheel Causes the Screen to Jump","I've had this mouse for just over a year, and have had to disassemble it twice to clean the scroll wheel area. It's not a difficult job, but I have had decent mice of other brands last much longer before any maintenance was required. While cleaning, I found dust and dirt inside the mouse, so it might behoove Razer to seal their products a bit better.
Update: I now have to disassemble the mouse monthly to clean the scroll wheel. Razer offers absolutely no advice other than to use compressed air to clean it and make certain software and firmware are up to date. The company has no way to contact them once the warranty expires, so I have dropped my rating from four to two stars, and have decided I will not purchase any of their products in the future.",0,Negative

That being said, I guess it's true; Don't judge a book by its cover. Having them for awhile they are great.
The headset is made out of a high grade plastic that is light weight that you can wear for hours and I mean hours without feeling discomfort. The pads fit around the ears perfectly, the sound is crisp, and the microphone is heavenly as my discord buds said. I can say with the noise cancel my son sat by me for awhile didn't even know he was there until he yelled HI DAD!
The adjuster strap is a thick, soft and contours to your head. Took me about 5 mins to make it perfect.

The only thing I don't like is that the USB C-connector is at a right angle to the cable instead of inline. This is the first charging cable I've owned that does and it takes some getting used to. It doesn't charge as fast as my OEM cable did but it does charge steadily/consistently, which I appreciate since I mostly charge overnight. I'd buy this again if I could find a version that didn't have the angled C-connector (I find it extremely counterintuitive) ... and/or a version with two USB C-connectors.

Luke Thorssen,4,01/14/2024,Mercury White,BEST BUDGET MOUSE! Only one compaint,"I LOVE this mouse. I got it after getting back into PC gaming after a hiatus.

PROS:
-Feels great in-hand.
-Cable is plenty long.
-It's not heavy, but it has a decent weight to it.
-Build quality is solid.

CONS:
-The only bad thing I have to say about this mouse is after a couple months of daily use, the scroll wheel sensors don't function properly. After doing some research, it looks like dust builds up on the sensor, making the wheel ""bounce"" when scrolling.

SIMPLE FIX: Blow into the space between the mouse and the scroll wheel. If you have pressurized air that will work much better. It's only a temporary fix, and can get annoying, but it does fix the issue!

Other than that one issue, this mouse is incredible for the price. Likely will upgrade to something a little more ""pro"" in the future, but for the last few months this has held up great, and I'll likely use it for another 6+ months before upgrading.",1,Positive
